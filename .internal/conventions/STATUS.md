# Convention points — status & how to resume

This `.internal/conventions/` kit is the home of the notebook-uniformity effort.
The live audit is `python3 .internal/conventions/report.py` (from the repo
root) — **trust it for current coverage**, not the prose below.

Scope: unless noted, a point was applied to the **`main` folders** only
(`algorithms/`, `applications/`, `tutorials/`, ~163 notebooks). `community/`,
`functions/`, and `benchmarking/` are reached by re-running the same agent/tool.

> **Parked as _old_ — execution-API refactor.** `execution_interface`,
> `result_value`, and `result_var` were shaped _before_ the execution API was
> refactored, which superseded them. They stay in the report marked _old_ (for
> the record), not as active work — `result_value` is still auto-enforced by the
> pre-commit hook.
>
> **`intro_opener` was dropped** — we decided not to pursue the "This notebook …"
> opener convention. It stays in the report marked _dropped_.
>
> **`section_vocab` was removed** (not just parked) — its heuristic mostly flagged
> good, specific headings, so folding them into a fixed vocabulary lost information.
> See the note in `report.py`.
>
> **`math` is on hold by design.** The pass is largely done, but finalizing it
> waits on confirming the `$$` / LaTeX changes don't break LaTeX rendering
> _elsewhere_ (e.g. the docs site).

Rows below follow the report's own order (skeleton → prose → code → parked).

Not a point: **sidecar files** (`.qmod` / `.synth` / `.metadata`) — out of scope here.

## To extend an agent-driven point to community / functions

1. `python3 .internal/conventions/report.py --rule <point> --list` to list the
   offending notebooks.
2. Batch them (~6 per agent) and run the relevant `agents/*.md` on each, editing
   **markdown cells only** via `tools/md_replace.py` (or `tools/rename_var.py` for code).
3. Verify per notebook with `tools/math_lint.py` / `tools/nonascii.py` and a
   `jupyter nbconvert --to markdown` render (no `--execute`).

## History

The passes landed as a family of `update_notebook_convention__*` branches
(show / references / result_value, single_h1 / headings, synthesize_main, unicode,
math, qprog_var / result_var, …). Several are already merged to `main`; the rest,
plus the report and this kit, are consolidated on the `conventions_kit` branch. See
the repo's PR list for the authoritative merged/open state.
