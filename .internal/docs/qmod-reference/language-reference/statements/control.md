# Control

The _control_ statement applies a unitary operation conditionally, depending on a quantum state,
and optionally a different one if the condition doesn't hold.
The unitary operations are specified as nested statement blocks.
The objects used in the statement blocks become entangled with the object used in the condition,
so that any superposition in the state of the condition carries over to the operations in the statement blocks.
The control statement could be viewed as the quantum equivalent of the classical _if_ statement,
with a _then_ block and an optional _else_ block.

The condition can be specified in one of two forms: as a single quantum variable, and as
a quantum logical expression.

## Syntax

=== "Native"

    **control** **(** _ctrl-var_ **)** **{** _statements_ **}** [**else** **{** _else-statements_ **}**]

    **control** **(** _ctrl-expression_ **)** **{** _statements_ **}** [**else** **{** _else-statements_ **}**]

=== "Python"

    [comment]: DO_NOT_TEST
    ```python
    def control(
        ctrl: Union[SymbolicExpr, QBit, QArray[QBit]],
        stmt_block: Union[QCallable, Callable[[], None]],
        else_block: Union[QCallable, Callable[[], None], None] = None,
    ) -> None:
        pass
    ```

## Semantics

-   _ctrl-var_ (in the first variant) is a quantum variable of type `qbit` or `qbit[]`, and
    _ctrl-expression_ (in the second variant) is a logical expression over a quantum variable.
-   The statement block is applied if all the qubits in _ctrl_ are in state $|1\rangle$ (in the
    first variant), or if the _ctrl-expression_ evaluates to `true` (in the second variant).
-   else-statements block is optional, and is applied if the negation of the condition holds,
    that is, if at least one of the qubits in ctrl is in state $|1\rangle$ (in the first variant),
    or if the ctrl-expression evaluates to False (in the second variant).
-   Currently, there exists a single limitation on the expression: if _ctrl-expression_ is an equality between a single
    variable and a classical expression, it is restricted to integers, meaning:
    In a _ctrl-expression_ of the form `<var> == <classical-expression>`, `<var>` should be a `qnum` with zero fraction
    places or a `qbit`, and `<classical-expression>` should evaluate to an integer.
-   The same variable cannot occur both in the condition and inside the statement block. This
    restriction applies also to mutually exclusive slices of the same variable.
-   Quantum variables declared outside the _control_ statement and used in its condition or
    inside its nested block must be initialized prior to it and remain initialized subsequently.
-   Quantum variables declared inside the _control_ statement, including in
    nested function calls, must be uninitialized at the end of the statement.

## Examples

### Example 1: Single-qubit control

In the following example, `control` statement applies function `X` on the variable `target`
conditioned on a single qubit variable `qb`. Note that this is equivalent to using the
built-in gate-level function `CX`.

=== "Native"

    ```
    qfunc main(output target: qbit) {
      qb: qbit;
      allocate(qb);
      H(qb);
      allocate(target);
      control (qb) {
        X(target);
      }
    }
    ```

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from classiq import H, Output, QBit, X, allocate, control, qfunc


    @qfunc
    def main(target: Output[QBit]) -> None:
        qb = QBit()
        allocate(qb)
        H(qb)
        allocate(target)
        control(qb, lambda: X(target))
    ```

Synthesizing this model creates the quantum program shown below.

### Example 2: Multi-qubit control

The next example shows how `control` can be similarly used with multi-qubit control
variable. In this case `target` is rotated when the state of `qba` is the bit string 111.

=== "Native"

    ```
    qfunc main(output target: qbit) {
      qba: qbit[];
      allocate(3, qba);
      hadamard_transform(qba);
      allocate(target);
      control (qba) {
        RX(pi / 2, target);
      }
    }
    ```

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from sympy import pi
    from classiq import *


    @qfunc
    def main(target: Output[QBit]) -> None:
        qba = QArray()
        allocate(3, qba)
        hadamard_transform(qba)
        allocate(target)
        control(qba, lambda: RX(pi / 2, target))
    ```

Synthesizing this model creates the quantum program shown below.

### Example 3: Numeric equality condition

The following example demonstrates the use of `control` to rotate the state of a qubit
by an angle determined by another quantum variable. In this case the condition compares
the quantum variable with the repeat index.

=== "Native"

    ```
    qfunc switch_rx(x: qnum, target: qbit) {
      repeat (i: 4) {
        control (x == i) {
          RX(pi / (2 ** i), target);
        }
      }
    }

    qfunc main(output res: qbit) {
      allocate(res);
      x: qnum;
      x = 2;
      switch_rx(x, res);
    }
    ```

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from classiq import *
    from classiq.qmod.symbolic import pi


    @qfunc
    def switch_rx(x: QNum, target: QBit) -> None:
        repeat(4, lambda i: control(x == i, lambda: RX(pi / 2**i, target)))


    @qfunc
    def main(res: Output[QBit]):
        allocate(res)
        x = QNum()
        x |= 2
        switch_rx(x, res)
    ```

Synthesizing this model creates the following quantum program. Note how `control`
is implemented as positive and negative controls in the respective numeric qubits.

### Example 4: Arithmetic condition

The following example demonstrates the use of `control` to rotate the state of a qubit
according to a condition imposed by another two quantum variables, `x` and `y`. Here, the condition
filters quantum states such that `y <= x[0] + x[1] + x[2]`.

=== "Native"

    ```
    qfunc switch_rx(x: qbit[], y: qnum, target: qbit) {
        control (y <= x[0] + x[1] + x[2]) {
          RX(pi / 3, target);
        }
    }

    qfunc main(output res: qbit) {
        allocate(res);
        x: qbit[3];
        y: qnum<3, UNSIGNED, 0>;
        allocate(x);
        allocate(y);
        hadamard_transform(x);
        hadamard_transform(y);
        switch_rx(x, y, res);
    }
    ```

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from classiq import *
    from classiq.qmod.symbolic import pi


    @qfunc
    def switch_rx(x: QArray[QBit], y: QNum, target: QBit) -> None:
        control(x[0] + x[1] + x[2] >= y, lambda: RX(pi / 3, target))


    @qfunc
    def main(res: Output[QBit]) -> None:
        allocate(res)
        x: QArray = QArray("x", QBit, 3)
        y: QNum = QNum("y", 3, UNSIGNED, 0)
        allocate(x)
        allocate(y)
        hadamard_transform(x)
        hadamard_transform(y)
        switch_rx(x, y, res)
    ```

Synthesizing this model creates the following quantum program. Note how `control`
is implemented as a result of an arithmetic computation. After applying the `control` operation,
the arithmetic operation is uncomputed.

### Example 5: Control else

The following example demonstrates the use of the `else` block in the `control` statement.
In this case, the `else` block applies an 'H' gate on the target qubit when the control
condition is not met, instead of the 'X' gate,
so when each qubit of the control variable is in state $|1\rangle$, the bit is flipped,
otherwise, the Hadamard gate is applied.

=== "Native"

    ```
    qfunc main(output x: qbit, output ctrl: qbit[]) {
      allocate(2, ctrl);
      hadamard_transform(ctrl);
      allocate(x);
      control (ctrl) {
        X(x);
      } else {
        H(x);
      }
    }
    ```

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from classiq import *


    @qfunc
    def main(x: Output[QBit], ctrl: Output[QArray[QBit]]):
        allocate(2, ctrl)
        hadamard_transform(ctrl)
        allocate(x)
        control(ctrl, lambda: X(x), lambda: H(x))
    ```

Synthesizing this model creates the following quantum program. Note how the `else` block
is implemented as a negation of the control condition, and the negation is uncomputed after
the `control` operation of the else block.
