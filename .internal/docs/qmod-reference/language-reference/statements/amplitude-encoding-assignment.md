# Amplitude-Encoding Assignment

Amplitude-encoding assignment represents the evaluation of an expression over a quantum variable
in the amplitudes of the resulting state. The target qubit serves as an indicator
for the success of the computation. Supported expressions include a number of useful math functions,
including trigonometric functions and multiplicative invert ($x^{-1}$).

## Syntax

=== "Native"

    _target-var_ ***=** _quantum-expression_

=== "Python"

    _target-var_ **\*=** _quantum-expression_ <br/>
    OR <br/>
    **assign_amplitude(**_quantum-expression_**,** _target-var_**)**

    #### Notes

    * The operator syntax and the function call syntax are equivalent. The
      operator syntax is typically easier to read, but it cannot be used
      directly in lambda expressions, where the function call syntax should be
      used.

## Semantics

-   _target-var_ must be initialized prior to the assignment.
-   _expression_ consists of a single quantum scalar variable, numeric constant
    literals, and classical scalar variables, composed using arithmetic operators and math functions.
    See the set of supported operators under [Numeric Assignment](./numeric-assignment.md).
    In addition to these operators, the functions in package `qmod.symbolic` are also supported.
-   _expression_ must evaluate to a real number in the domain [-1, 1]. Values that exceed
    this range are trimmed. Poles of the expression are ignored (set to 0). For example, given
    the expression `1/x`, the zero state of `x` is ignored, as it is undefined.
-   For _expression_ over quantum variable $x$ that computes the function $f(x)$, the operation
    performed by the statement is -

$|x\rangle |0\rangle \rightarrow \sqrt{1-f^2(x)}|x\rangle |0\rangle +
f(x)|x\rangle |1\rangle$

## Examples

### Example 1

In the following example, the function $f(x) = x^2$ is computed over a quantum variable `x`:

=== "Native"

    ```
    qfunc main(output x: qnum<5, UNSIGNED, 5>, output ind: qbit) {
      allocate(x);
      hadamard_transform(x);
      allocate(ind);
      ind *= x**2;
    }
    ```

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from classiq import *


    @qfunc
    def main(x: Output[QNum[5, UNSIGNED, 5]], ind: Output[QBit]) -> None:
        allocate(x)
        hadamard_transform(x)
        allocate(ind)
        ind *= x**2
    ```

Synthesizing and executing this model results in the histogram shown below. States
with the variable `ind` sampled as 1 (on the right side of the histogram) have
probabilities corresponding to $(x^2)^2$. The probability of states with `ind` sampled
as 0 (on the left side of the histogram) correspond to $1-(x^2)^2$.

### Example 2: Quantum Subscript

In this example, we demonstrate amplitude-encoding assignment with a
quantum subscript expression, i.e., a classical list indexed by a quantum
numeric variable.

=== "Native"

    ```
    qfunc main(output x: qnum<2>, output ind: qbit) {
      allocate(x);
      hadamard_transform(x);
      allocate(ind);
      ind *= [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4][x];
    }
    ```

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from classiq import *
    from classiq.qmod.symbolic import subscript


    @qfunc
    def main(x: Output[QNum[2]], ind: Output[QBit]) -> None:
        allocate(x)
        hadamard_transform(x)
        allocate(ind)
        ind *= subscript([0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4], x)
    ```
