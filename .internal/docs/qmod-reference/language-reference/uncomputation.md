# Uncomputation

<!-- cspell:ignore Toffoli -->

Uncomputation is the process of reversing the effects of quantum operations,
restoring the state of qubits to their initial $|0\rangle$ state. Failing to
properly uncompute intermediate results can lead to incorrect final measurement
results and wasted resources. In Qmod, intermediate results are typically
stored in local variables, which are scoped inside a function and are
inaccessible outside of it. Hence, local variables must be used in a way that
enables subsequent uncomputation. Specifically, their interactions with other
objects must be restrictive to be subsequently disentangled from them.

To enforce the restrictions, quantum operations are classified into arbitrary
functions and _permutation_-only functions. In addition, each of an operation's
parameters is classified as either _const_ or _non-const_.

-   **permutation**: A quantum operation is a _permutation_ if it maps
    computational-basis states to computational-basis states (with possible
    phase shifts). Such an operation neither introduces nor destroys quantum
    superpositions, and its computation can be described classically.
-   **const**: A parameter of a quantum operation is constant if it is
    immutable up to a phase. That is, the magnitudes of its computational-basis
    state components remain unchanged, while their phases may shift.

_permutation_ functions are explicity declared using the keyword
`qperm`. _const_ parameters are explicity declared using the keyword
`const`. See more under [Function Declarations](functions.md).

??? Examples

    - `Z` is a _permutation_ and its parameter is _const_ as it merely flips the phase
      of the $|1\rangle$ state.
    - `X` is a _permutation_ but its parameter is not _const_ as it flips between
      $|0\rangle$ and $|1\rangle$.
    - `H` is not a _permutation_ and its parameter is not _const_, as it
      introduces superposition.
    - `SWAP` is a _permutation_ but its two parameters are not _const_, as it
      swaps between $|01\rangle$ and $|10\rangle$.

## Quantum operations classification

Each quantum operation is classified as either an arbitrary mutation of the quantum
state or strictly a _permutation_ of computational-basis states, according to the
following rules:

-   A function call is a _permutation_ if the callee is declared as `qperm`.
-   A numeric assignment (both out-of-place and in-place) is a _permutation_.
-   Amplitude-encoding assignment is _non-permutation_.
-   Phase statement is a _permutation_.
-   A compound statement is a _permutation_ if its body contains only _permutation_
    operations. For example, a _control_ statement is a _permutation_ if all
    statements inside its _then_ and _else_ clauses are _permutations_.
-   Bind statement is considered a _permutation_, as are `allocate` and
    `free`.

In addition, each use of a quantum variable is classified as either _const_ or
_non-const_:

-   An argument in a function call is classified according to the modifier used
    in the matching parameter declaration.
-   Use as right-value quantum expression is _const_. Right-value expressions
    occur in the following contexts:
    -   On the right-hand side of a numeric assignment or amplitude-encoding assignment.
    -   As the condition in a _control_ statement.
    -   As the argument of a _phase_ statement.
-   Use as left-value expression in numeric assignments (both out-of-place and
    in-place) and amplitude-encoding assignments is _non-const_.
-   Arguments to a _bind_ statement are treated specially: they are not
    immediately classified, but are instead bound together and assigned a
    joint classification of either _const_ or _non-const_.

### Enforcement of function classification

Generally, a `qperm` function is restricted to use only _permutation_
operations, and a `const` parameter is restricted to _const_ use contexts.
Violation of these restrictions results in a compilation error.

However, flexibility is often required in the implementation of lower-level
building blocks. The cumulative effect of the function on the quantum
parameters in these cases satisfies its declared restrictions, but individual
operations violate it. Well known examples are the implementation of Toffoli gate,
and arithmetic addition in the Fourier bases. Both are permutation-only operations
taken as a whole, but internally use Hadamard gates and rotations.

It is not scalable to validate the correct cumulative effect of a description
automatically in the general case. However, you can suppress the fine-grained
enforcement of function classification with the `disable_perm_check` and
`disable_const_checks` specifiers using the following syntax:

=== "Native"

    Before a function definition you may specify the following decorators:

    **@disable_perm_check**

    **@disable_const_checks** [ **(** _parameters_ **)** ]

    Where _parameters_ is an optional list of comma-separated parameter names (if
    the list is omitted, the checks are disabled for all _const_ parameters).

=== "Python"

    The decorators `@qfunc` and `@qperm` have the optional parameters
    `disable_perm_check` and `disable_const_checks` declared thus -

      disable_perm_check: bool = False

      disable_const_checks: Union[list[str], bool] = False

    `disable_const_checks` may contain a list of parameter names, or a boolean
    to disable the checks for all _const_ parameters.

When `disable_perm_check` is used, the compiler does not enforce the usage of
_non-permutation_ operations. When `disable_const_checks` is used, the compiler
does not enforce use context restrictions on the listed parameters (or all
parameters if none specified).

### Examples

#### Example 1 - Correct use of permutation and const parameters

In the example below, function `foo` is declared `qperm`, and its first
parameter `param1` is declared `const`. The definition of `foo` is consistent
with these declarations. Note that the restriction on `param1` is carried over
to its use in the lambda expression passed to `apply_to_all`.

=== "Native"

    ```
    qperm foo(const param1: qnum, output param2: qnum) {
      param2 = param1 + 1;  // OK - assignment is a permutation and RHS is const
      apply_to_all(lambda(qb) {
        Z(qb);
      }, param1);  // OK - the parameter of 'Z' is const
    }
    ```

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from classiq import *


    @qperm
    def foo(param1: Const[QNum], param2: Output[QNum]):
        param2 |= param1 + 1  # OK - assignment is a permutation and RHS is const
        apply_to_all(lambda qb: Z(qb), param1)  # OK - the parameter of 'Z' is const
    ```

#### Example 2 - Incorrect use of permutation and const parameters

The example below demonstrates violations of the restrictions on the use of
parameters and operations. As in the previous example, the function `foo` is
declared `qperm` and its first parameter `param1` is declared `const`. However,
the use of `param1` violates the restriction, and the function uses a
_non-permutation_ operation as well.

=== "Native"

    ```
    qperm foo(const param1: qnum, output param2: qnum) {
      param1 += 2;  // Error - LHS is non-const
      hadamard_transform(param2);  // Error - 'hadamard_transform' is non-permutation
    ```

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from classiq import *


    @qperm
    def foo(param1: Const[QNum], param2: Output[QNum]):
        param1 += 2  # Error - LHS is non-const
        hadamard_transform(param2)  # Error - 'hadamard_transform' is non-permutation
    ```

#### Example 3 - Disabling permutation check

In the example below, function `my_cx` implements the CX operation using a
simple equivalence - applying phase flip in the Hadamard basis. The cumulative
operation on the quantum state is a _permutation_, but individual calls to `H` are
not. The `disable_perm_check` is used to suppress compiler errors in this case.

=== "Native"

    ```
    @disable_perm_check
    qperm my_cx(const ctrl: qbit, tgt: qbit) {
      H(tgt);
      CZ(ctrl, tgt);
      H(tgt);
    }
    ```

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from classiq import *


    @qperm(disable_perm_check=True)
    def my_cx(ctrl: Const[QBit], tgt: QBit):
        H(tgt)
        CZ(ctrl, tgt)
        H(tgt)
    ```

#### Example 4 - Disabling permutation check and const checks

In the example below, function `my_z` implements the Z operation using a
simple equivalence - applying bit flip in the Hadamard basis. The cumulative
operation on the quantum state is a _permutation_, but individual calls to `H` are
not. Also, the cumulative operation on the `tgt` is _const_, but individual
calls are not.
The `disable_perm_check` and `disable_const_checks` are used to suppress
compiler errors in this case.

=== "Native"

    ```
    @disable_perm_check
    @disable_const_checks
    qperm my_z(const tgt: qbit) {
      H(tgt);
      X(tgt);
      H(tgt);
    }
    ```

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from classiq import *


    @qperm(disable_perm_check=True, disable_const_checks=True)
    def my_z(tgt: Const[QBit]):
        H(tgt)
        X(tgt)
        H(tgt)
    ```

## Semantics of uncomputation

When a variable is initialized inside the _within_ block of a _within-apply_
statement, it is returned to its uninitialized state after the statement
completes. The newly allocated quantum object is uncomputed, and its qubits are
reclaimed by the compiler for subsequent use. Likewise, a variable declared locally
within a function is only accessible inside the function's scope. The quantum object
allocated inside the function may be uncomputed at some later point and its
qubits reclaimed. Uncomputation is forced when a function with a local variable
is called (directly or indirectly) from the _within_ block of a _within-apply_
statement. For more details on _within-apply_ see
[Within-apply](statements/within-apply.md).

Local variables are considered _uncomputation candidates_ if they remain initialized at the
end of the function scope in which they were declared. Variables initialized inside a
_within_ block of a _within-apply_ statement are also considered uncomputation candidates
in the scope of the statement.
following rules guarantee that uncomputation candidates can be handled
correctly:

-   An uncomputation candidate must not be used in a _non-permutation_ operation.
-   A variable initialized inside a _within_ block of a _within-apply_ statement can
    only be used in _const_ contexts inside the _apply_ block.
-   A variable becomes a _dependency_ of an uncomputation candidate when used
    in an operation together with the candidate variable, and the latter is used in
    a non-_const_ context. From that point, the dependency variable is subject to
    the same rules as the candidate variable, while the latter is in scope.

Violating these rules will result in a compilation error.

### Examples

#### Example 1 - Correct uncomputation in within-apply

The example below demonstrates the use of a local variable initialized inside a
_within_ block of a _within-apply_ statement. Variable `aux` is initialized as
the left-value expression of an assignment statement, which is a _permutation_
operation. In the _apply_ block, it is used as the condition of a _control_
statement, which is a _const_ context. Both uses are valid, and the variable is
uncomputed and freed correctly after the _within-apply_ statement.

=== "Native"

    ```
    qfunc main(output qn: qnum, output res: qbit) {
      allocate(2, qn);
      hadamard_transform(qn);
      allocate(1, res);
      aux: qbit;
      within {
        aux = qn > 1;
      } apply {
        control (aux) {
          X(res);
        }
      }
    }
    ```

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from classiq import *


    @qfunc
    def main(qn: Output[QNum], res: Output[QBit]):
        allocate(2, qn)
        hadamard_transform(qn)
        allocate(res)
        aux = QBit()
        within_apply(
            within=lambda: assign(qn > 1, aux), apply=lambda: control(aux, lambda: X(res))
        )
    ```

#### Example 2 - Illegal use of local variable in within-apply

The code below is a modification of _Example 1_ above, with a couple of lines
added to demonstrate violations of the rules for correct use of a variable
initialized inside the _within_ block of a _within-apply_ statement. Here,
variable `aux` is also used as the argument of function `H` in the _within_
block. This is an arbitrarily _non-permutation_ operation (indeed `H` introduces
superposition between computational-basis states). In addition, `aux` is used
as the argument of function `X` in the _apply_ block, which is _non-const_
context. Both uses are illegal, and both are reported as errors by the
compiler.

=== "Native"

    ```
    qfunc main(output qn: qnum, output res: qbit) {
      allocate(2, qn);
      hadamard_transform(qn);
      allocate(1, res);
      aux: qbit;
      within {
        aux = qn > 1;
        H(aux);
      } apply {
        control (aux) {
          X(res);
        }
        X(aux);
      }
    }
    ```

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from classiq import *


    @qfunc
    def main(qn: Output[QNum], res: Output[QBit]):
        allocate(2, qn)
        hadamard_transform(qn)
        allocate(res)
        aux = QBit()
        within_apply(
            within=lambda: (
                assign(qn > 1, aux),
                H(aux),
            ),
            apply=lambda: (
                control(aux, lambda: X(res)),
                X(aux),
            ),
        )
    ```

#### Example 3 - Illegal use of dependent variable in within-apply

The following example demonstrates a violation of the rules for correct use of
a dependent variable inside a _within-apply_ statement. Here, variable `aux` is
initialized inside a _within_ block, and is subsequently entangled with `q1`
which is not an uncomputation candidate. From that point, the same restrictions
that hold for `aux` apply to `q1`. Therefore, using it as an argument to
function `H` is illegal, and is reported as an error. Indeed, if `foo` would
execute as specified, `aux` would not be uncomputed correctly.

=== "Native"

    ```
    qfunc foo(q1: qbit, q2: qbit) {
      aux: qbit;
      within {
        allocate(1, aux);
        CX(q1, aux);
        H(q1);
      } apply {
        CX(aux, q2);
        Z(q1);
      }
    }
    ```

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from classiq import *


    @qfunc
    def foo(q1: QBit, q2: QBit):
        aux = QBit()
        within_apply(
            within=lambda: (
                allocate(aux),
                CX(q1, aux),
                H(q1),
            ),
            apply=lambda: (CX(aux, q2), Z(q1)),
        )
    ```

#### Example 4 - Illegal use of local variable in function

The example below demonstrates incorrect use of a local variable inside a
function. Function `rand_increment` initializes a local variable `temp` in a
superposition state, using `prepare_state`, and is subsequently entangled with
the parameter `qn`. This makes it impossible to uncompute `temp`. `temp` is a
local variable and therefore an uncomputation candidate. Passing it as argument
to `prepare_state` is flagged as an error, because it is not a _permutation_.
Note that if `rand_increment` would output `temp`
instead of declaring it as a local variable, the function would be legal.

=== "Native"

    ```
    qfunc rand_increment(qn: qnum) {
      temp: qnum;
      prepare_state([0, 0.8, 0.2, 0], 0, temp);
      qn += temp;
    }
    ```

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from classiq import *


    @qfunc
    def rand_increment(qn: QNum):
        temp = QNum()
        prepare_state([0, 0.8, 0.2, 0], 0, temp)
        qn += temp
    ```
