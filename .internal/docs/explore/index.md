# Classiq Library

This chapter contains a wide variety of functions, algorithms, applications and tutorials of quantum programs with Classiq. Everything can also be found in the [Classiq Git Library](https://github.com/Classiq/classiq-library), where you can contribute your own tutorials and algorithms that will appear in this documentation as well. In addition, all the examples can be found directly in the [Classiq platform](https://platform.classiq.io/) in the `Model` tab.
