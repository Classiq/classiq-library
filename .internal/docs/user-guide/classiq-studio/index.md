# **Classiq Studio - Web-based IDE with Classiq inside**

Classiq Studio is a VSCode environment part of the Classiq platform.
It bypasses the need to install the Python SDK package and its dependencies,
and includes the complete and updated Classiq Library git repository of quantum functions, algorithms, applications, and tutorials.

## **Key features**

**Code editing and running** – Write and modify your code using the latest Qmod and python SDK version in a fully featured editor with syntax highlighting, autocompletion, go-to definition, jupyterlab extension and more.
Using your favorite code editing tools - vscode or jupyterlab

**Work from anywhere** - We supply a persistent user workspace to save and manage code and projects.

**Instant onboarding** - Access the Classiq library contains tens of state of the art quantum algorithms ready for use.

**Integrated debugging** – Step through execution and inspect intermediate results.

## **Getting started**

**Access the Classiq Studio** – Open the Classiq Studio from the [Classiq platform](https://platform.classiq.io/) (after registration) and follow the instructions [here](Classiq-Studio-Guide.md)

**Write Your First Program** – Use the editor to create your first quantum program or load an example of our applications from the build in Classiq library.

## **Next steps**

-   Explore the code editor guide to learn about the features, capabilities and best practice of the editor

-   Read the [Qmod reference](../../qmod-reference/index.md), [SDK reference](../../sdk-reference/index.md) and the [Execution section](../execution/index.md) to get started with Classiq and start writing and running quantum algorithms and programs.
