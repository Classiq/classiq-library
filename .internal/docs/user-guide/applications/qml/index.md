# Quantum Machine Learning

Quantum machine learning (QML) is a field that seeks to combine the principles of
quantum mechanics and machine learning to develop new algorithms and techniques that
can process and analyze data more efficiently.

The Classiq platform has a few QML built-in algorithms:

-   With [Quantum Neural Network (QNN)](qnn/index.md), you can combine classical and quantum neural network layers.
