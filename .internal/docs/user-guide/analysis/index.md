# Analysis

The Classiq product requires information from the synthesis so it can automatically generate a quantum program. This fact is even more important for large quantum programs, where simulation may not even be an option.
The Classiq analyzer comprises a web application plus analysis data and graphs that provide information about a quantum program, primarily so there is no need to simulate it.

These sections describe how to use the web application, data, and graphs, and give a comprehensive walkthrough of the components:

-   [Data Analysis and Graphs](data-analysis-and-graphs.md)
-   [Automatic Register Resolution](automatic-registers.md)
