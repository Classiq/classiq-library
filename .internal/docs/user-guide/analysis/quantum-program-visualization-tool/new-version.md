# New version

The Quantum Program visualization bridges the high-level algorithm descriptions (as it is captured in Qmod) with their quantum implementations (as synthesized by the Classiq engine). The tool offers two key innovations: **functional block hierarchies** and **quantum data flow** representations.

The **quantum data flow** view lets users track quantum variables, including higher-level types like numbers, arrays, and structs, along with their qubit allocations. This aids in understanding data flow and memory allocation within quantum algorithms.

**Functional block hierarchies** enable navigation between different levels of abstraction, from high-level functional blocks to individual quantum gates, offering a more thorough exploration of the algorithm's structure.

The QP visualization tool provides an interactive way to analyze quantum programs by focusing on the quantum data-flow between functional blocks. Here’s a breakdown of its key features and functionality:

#### Purpose

-   Analyze the implementation of the quantum model (Qmod) as synthesized by the Classiq engine.
-   Verify the data flow within the quantum program, enabling debugging and deeper analysis

#### Hierarchical Structure

-   Allows users to traverse different levels of the quantum model implementation, from high-level Qmod functions down to atomic functions.

    Double clicking a function block opens and collapses the internal hierarchies:

#### Color Coding

The visualization uses colors to help distinguish different block categories:

-   **Yellow**: Represents Qmod function blocks (either written by the user or taken from the Classiq library).
-   **Turquoise**: Represents Qmod statement blocks (such as: control, invert, power, within-apply, assignment).
-   **Grey**: Represents built-in functional blocks (generated by the Classiq engine during synthesis).

#### Data Flow Analysis

Data flow between functional blocks is presented in terms of the Qmod variables:

-   **Purple lines** represent the flow of quantum variables throughout the program.
-   The **purple dot** marks where a variable is initialized.
-   When variables split or merge (via slicing or the bind operation), the purple lines update to show the changes.
-   The variable’s name and size are also displayed along the purple lines, making it easier to track their initialization, usage and transformations.

This structured approach allows for a clear understanding of the program’s execution, providing users with a tool to validate the accuracy and efficiency of their quantum programs.
