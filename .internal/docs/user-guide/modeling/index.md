# Modeling

This under construction section is where you can learn the concepts and syntax needed to design quantum models—simply put, to write quantum code using Classiq.

If you prefer a faster, exercise-oriented path to learning, see the [Classiq Tutorial](../../getting-started/classiq_tutorial/index.md).

For a complete, formal specification of the language, refer to the [language reference](../../qmod-reference/language-reference).
