# Execution on Azure Quantum Cloud

The Classiq executor supports execution on Azure Quantum cloud simulators and hardware.

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
!!! tip
    Backends may sometimes be unavailable. Check the availability windows with Azure Quantum.
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

## Usage

Possible modes of operation:

-   Running through Classiq-Azure integration. In this mode you do not need to provide credentials or location.
-   Executing on your private Azure Quantum Workspace by providing credentials.
    For more details, see [Executing on Your Quantum Workspace](#executing-on-your-quantum-workspace).

=== "SDK"

    [comment]: DO_NOT_TEST

    ```python
    from classiq import (
        AzureCredential,
        AzureBackendPreferences,
    )

    # Running through Classiq-Azure integration:
    preferences = AzureBackendPreferences(
        backend_name="Name of requsted simulator or hardware",
    )

    # Running through a private Azure account:
    cred = AzureCredential(
        tenant_id="Azure Tenant ID (from Azure Active Directory)",
        client_id="Azure Application (client) ID",
        client_secret="Azure Client Secret",
        resource_id="Azure Quantum Workspace Resource ID",
    )

    preferences = AzureBackendPreferences(
        backend_name="Name of requsted simulator or hardware",
        credentials=cred,
        location="Azure region of Quantum Workspace",
    )
    ```

=== "IDE"

For academic users, backends run through Classiq-Azure integration by default. To override this configuration, switch on "Run with my own credentials" in the backends summary section on the Execution page:

## Executing on Your Quantum Workspace

Execution on your private Azure Quantum Workspace requires an Azure account with
an active subscription. To authenticate, provide these details:

-   `Resource ID`: Azure Quantum Workspace resource ID.
-   `Location`: Azure region of the Quantum Workspace.
-   `Tenant ID`: Azure Active Directory tenant ID.
-   `Client ID`: Azure client ID of a registered application.
-   `Client secret`: Azure client secret of a registered application.

Following is a brief description of the steps to configure and acquire these details:

1. Create an Azure Quantum Workspace (see
   [Azure documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/quantum/how-to-create-workspace)).
   In the workspace overview are the `Location` and `Resource ID`.

2. Register a new application in Azure, including creating a client secret (see
   [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/python/sdk/authentication-on-premises-apps?tabs=azure-portal#1---register-the-application-in-azure)).
   At the end of this step are the settings for `Client ID`, `Client secret`, and `Tenant ID`.

3. Assign the `Contributor` role to the registered application on the Quantum Workspace
   or a resource group containing the Quantum Workspace (see
   [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/python/sdk/authentication-on-premises-apps?tabs=azure-portal#2---assign-roles-to-the-application-service-principal)).

4. Add the `Jobs.ReadWrite` permission (under `Azure Quantum`) to the application (see
   [Azure documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-add-app-roles-in-azure-ad-apps#assign-app-roles-to-applications)).
