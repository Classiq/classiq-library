# What's Next?

Congratulations on completing Classiq 101!

You are now ready to begin your own way with Classiq. Choose your path:

-   [Explore](../explore/index.md) quantum algorithm tutorials
-   [Read](../user-guide/read/index.md) tutorials covering advanced topics
-   [Practice](../user-guide/practice/index.md) on the collection of exercises

Do you want to implement a new quantum algorithm with Classiq? Check out the [Git library](https://github.com/Classiq/classiq-library) for possibilities and contribute your algorithm to the library for the benefit of the entire community!
