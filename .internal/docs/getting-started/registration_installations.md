# Registration and Installation

To use [Classiq platform](https://platform.classiq.io/) for free for non-commercial purposes, you must register. Then you can optionally use our coding studio (web-based IDE) or install the Python SDK package and authenticate your account. This page guides you through the steps.

## Registration

At [platform.classiq.io](https://platform.classiq.io/), click Sign Up. Approve the terms of use and register with your Google/Microsoft account or any other email:

<div style="text-align:center;">

</div>

Upon completion, you will be directed to the Classiq platform home page.

## Slack Registration

Classiq has a vibrant and active [Slack community](https://short.classiq.io/join-slack) that is helpful for technical questions and support, as well as for general quantum computing questions and discussions. To join, click [here](https://short.classiq.io/join-slack) and sign up to the Classiq Community Slack workspace with your Google/Apple account or a general email address:

</div>

## Classiq Studio

The Classiq platform has a web-based code editor, that allows you to create and run Python code with a pre-set environment. You can access it through the [Classiq Platform](https://platform.classiq.io/).
For more information check out our [Classiq Studio user guide](../user-guide/classiq-studio/index.md)

## Python SDK Installation

The Classiq platform has an accompanying Python SDK package that is integrated with the Classiq platform. **After registering to the platform**, install the SDK package using `pip`:

**NOTE** - The SDK is currently supported for Python versions `3.8` to `3.12`.

```terminal
pip install -U classiq
```

<details>
<summary>pip install options</summary>

Run `pip install -U classiq` in your command line, or use `!pip install -U classiq` from your Python IDE.  
Make sure you are within the appropriate Python environment.

</details>

Authenticate the device with your Classiq account. **In Python**, run these lines:

```Python
import classiq
classiq.authenticate()
```

A confirmation window opens in your web browser. Confirm the authentication:

<div style="text-align:center;">
    <img src="https://docs.classiq.io/resources/signup_authentication.png" style="width:70%;" />
</div>

Once you receive the confirmation you are good to go!

If you encounter an issue, look for a solution in the [troubleshooting section](#Python-sdk-installation-troubleshooting) or ask in the [community Slack](https://short.classiq.io/join-slack).

## Platform Version Updates

Every few weeks a new version of the Classiq platform launches. The web-based IDE at [platform.classiq.io](https://platform.classiq.io/) automatically updates.

Update the Python SDK package manually with this command:

```terminal
pip install -U classiq
```

To update the Python SDK for a specific version, run this in the terminal:

```terminal
pip install classiq=={DESIRED_VERSION}
```

and replace the `DESIRED_VERSION` with the number of your desired version, e.g. `0.40`. You can check what version of Classiq is installed with:

```terminal
pip show classiq
```

**NOTE**: Only the last three versions of Classiq are supported. For example, if the current version is `0.41`, only versions `0.41`, `0.40`, and `0.39` are supported.

\*Once version `0.52` is released - execution of quantum programs with older SDK versions might result in errors or unexpected behavior. To ensure proper execution, upgrade your SDK to the latest version.

## Python SDK Installation Troubleshooting

<details>
<summary> Device is Not Authenticated </summary>

Try to use the following command in Python:

```Python
import classiq
classiq.authenticate(overwrite=True)
```

</details>

<details>
<summary> Authentication on Headless LINUX Systems </summary>

The authentication procedure on headless Linux systems stores the tokens locally in a credentials file. While you must still run the authentication once, it can be done on another system with a browser.
