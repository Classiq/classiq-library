# Getting Started

Welcome to Classiq!

This section will guide you through [**Registration & Installation**](registration_installations.md) and introduce you to the [**Classiq Tutorial**](classiq_tutorial/index.md), where you'll quickly gain hands on experience with high-level quantum programming.

We also invite you to join our [**Community Slack**](https://short.classiq.io/join-slack), where you can get technical support, exchange ideas, and connect with fellow users.
