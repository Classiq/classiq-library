# The Classiq Tutorial

Welcome to The Classiq Tutorial!

This is the place to gain hands-on experience in high-level quantum programming.

The tutorial consists of the following sections:

1. [Classiq Overview Tutorial](../classiq_tutorial/classiq_overview_tutorial.ipynb) - a full workflow with classiq, from designing a simple quantum model to execution and post processing the results.
2. Qmod Tutorial - introducing the Qmod language and its accompanying library. These are the building blocks of every quantum model.
    1. [Part 1](../classiq_tutorial/Qmod_tutorial_part1.ipynb) covers basic concepts and functions, which are relevant in most use-cases.
    2. [Part 2](../classiq_tutorial/Qmod_tutorial_part2.ipynb) goes into more advanced topics. Grasping these tools and ideas opens the door to a whole world of quantum algorithms and applications.
3. [Synthesis tutorial](../classiq_tutorial/synthesis_tutorial.ipynb) - introducing Classiq's synthesis engine and explaining how to use it for optimization of the resulting quantum program.
4. Execution tutorial - How to execute quantum programs, and how to post-process their outputs.
    1. [Part 1](../classiq_tutorial/execution_tutorial.ipynb) introduces how to execute a quantum program and process the sampling outputs.
    2. [Part 2](../classiq_tutorial/execution_tutorial_part2.ipynb) covers measurement of observables, execution of parameterized quantum circuits, and a workflow for variational quantum algorithms.
