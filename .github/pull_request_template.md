### Some notes

- [ ] Please make sure that you placed the files in an appropriate folder
- [ ] And that the files have indicative names.

- [ ] Please note that Classiq runs automatic code linting, which may minorly alter some files.
  - [ ] If you're familiar with `pre-commit`, you may run `pre-commit install`, and then at each commit, your files will be altered in a similar way
