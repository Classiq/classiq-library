### Some notes

- [ ] Please make sure that you placed the files in an appropriate folder
- [ ] And that the files have indicative names.

- [ ] Please make sure to run `pre-commit` when commiting changes
  - [ ] If you're using `git` in the terminal, make sure to install `pre-commit` via running `pip install pre-commit` followed by `pre-commit install`
    - [ ] More info at [the `pre-commit` documentation](https://pre-commit.com/)
  - [ ] Note that Classiq runs automatic code linting. Meaning that one of the tests verifies the output of `pre-commit`.
  - [ ] Also note that `pre-commit` may minorly alter some files. Make sure to `git add` the changes done by `pre-commit`
