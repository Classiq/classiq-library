        " VQE starts by initializing a parameterized quantum circuit known as the ansatz. The ansatz represents a trial wavefunction that is used to approximate the ground state of the Hamiltonian.\n",
        "\n",
        "The initialized ansatz is applied to a quantum state, and the energy expectation value of the Hamiltonian is measured. This measurement is performed using quantum operations and classical post-processing.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "The optimization process continues until a convergence criterion is met, such as reaching a specified number of iterations or achieving a desired energy threshold.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once the optimization converges, the final parameters of the ansatz correspond to an approximation of the ground state of the Hamiltonian. The energy associated with these parameters is the estimated ground state energy.\n",
        "\n",
        " The estimated ground state energy obtained from VQE can be compared to the exact ground state energy (if known) or used for further analysis in quantum chemistry, materials science, or other applications."
