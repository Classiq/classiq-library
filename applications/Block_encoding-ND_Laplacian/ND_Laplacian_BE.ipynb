    "\n",
    "Efficiently block encoding arbitrary matrices is a very difficult problem and this task is not trivial even for well structured and sparse matrices. The paper by Sturm et al. 2025 (https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02429), provides for efficient quantum circuits for block encoding $N-$ dimensional Laplacians, with periodic boundary conditions along all dimensions. This is useful in many applications, especially ones involving problems of linear algebra. Moreover, given an efficient block encoding of a matrix $\\tilde{A}$, its possible to efficiently construct a block encoding of certain polynomials of $\\tilde{A}$ through quantum singular value transformations (QSVT). \n",
