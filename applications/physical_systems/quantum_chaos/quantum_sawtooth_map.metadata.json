  "description": "This notebook provides an end-to-end implementation of the quantum sawtooth map on 3 qubits, constructing the Floquet operator as alternating diagonal phases in conjugate bases. It illustrates how Classiq Qmod’s language and execution framework, especially Classiq’s phase-assignment construct, can be used to easily define and run the dynamics, and to observe localization signatures. We use the simulator as a reference and directly compare the results to runs on real quantum hardware.",
