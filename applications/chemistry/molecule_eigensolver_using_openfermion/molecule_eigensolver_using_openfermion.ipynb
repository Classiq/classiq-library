    "In this tutorial we build a Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE), using Qmod and OpenFermion packages [[1](#OF)]. OpenFermion is a comprehensive library for defining and analyzing Fermionic systems, in particular quantum chemistry problems. It provides efficient tools for transforming Fermionic operators to Pauli operators, which are then can be used with Qmod to define quantum algorithms. Some basic usage of this quantum chemistry package is incorporated in the notebook, however, we encourage the reader to read its [intro tutorial](https://quantumai.google/openfermion/tutorials/intro_to_openfermion) [[2](#OFintro)].\n",

    "\n",
    "* **Part (A):** Define a molecule and get its second-quantized Hamiltonian for the electronic structure problem. This part is done with the `openfermionpyscf` package.\n",

    "* **Part (B):** Construct a transformation from Fermionic Fock space to Qubits space, including space reduction via symmetries. The latter depends on the Molecule Hamiltonian itself. This part is done with the `openfermion` package.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Part (C):** Build and run a VQE in the reduced Qubit space. The quantum primitives, such as Unitary Coupled Cluster (UCC) ansatz or Hartree Fock state preparation, are defined in the Fermionic Fock space. The quantum algorithm is thus consructed with the mapping defined in part (B). This part (C) is done with the `classiq` and its Qmod language."

In this tutorial we focus on the LiH molecule. There are several ways to get geometry of molecules, typical way involves using the *SMILES* (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) of a molecule and use a chemical package such as `RDkit` to extract the geometry as an `xyz` file (a code example is given at the end of this notebook in Appendix C). For simplicity, we store the geometry in advance in the `lih.xyz` file and load it.\n",

That means that there is a basis in which both $H$ and such $g$ operators are diagonal. These operators are assumed to be a single Pauli string, typically containing only Pauli $Z$ operators.\n",

Find a unitary transformation $U$ that diagonalizes all $g^{(i)}$, such that each generator operates trivially on all qubits except one, e.g., they transform to operators of the form $X_{l}$ for some qubit number $l$. It can be shown that such unitary can be constructed as $\\Pi^k_{i=1}\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\left(X_{m^{(i)}}+g^{(i)}\\right)$, where $X_{m^{(i)}}$ is operating on a some single qubit $m^{(i)}$.\n",

Instead of working with the generic approach, in this tutorial we will use some educated guess, according to some physical properties--- conservation laws--- of our system, to define several symmetry operations.
