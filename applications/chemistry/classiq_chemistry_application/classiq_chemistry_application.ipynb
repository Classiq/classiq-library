    "Now, Refs. [[3](#sym1)] and [[4](#sym2)] show, and this is implemented explicitly in Appendix B, that we can find a Clifford transformation $U$, such that the transformed Hamiltonian $H'=U^{\\dagger} H U$ commutes with the transformed symmetries $X_{m^{(i)}} = U^{\\dagger} g_i U$. We know how the eigenspaces of $X_{m^{(i)}}$ look like. For example, $X_{0}$ has two eigenspaces that correspond to the eigenvalues $\\pm 1$: $V_{\\pm} = \\left\\{|u\\rangle_N, X_{0}|u\\rangle_N = \\pm |u\\rangle_N\\right\\} = \\left\\{|\\pm\\rangle \\otimes |\\tilde{u}\\rangle_{N-1},\\, |\\tilde{u}\\rangle_{N-1} \\text{ some state on } N-1 \\text{ qubits}\\right\\} $.
