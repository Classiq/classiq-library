    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Protein folding is an important problem at the foundation of biological phenomena. If we could predict how a sequence of amino acids folds into a three-dimensional structure, it would greatly contribute to drug design and understanding diseases. However, the folding problem is extremely difficult in computational science.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Structure space grows explosively\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Each amino-acid residue has dihedral angles ψ and φ, and their combinations generate countless possible spatial structures.\n",
    "   * For example, if φ and ψ are each discretized into several dozen levels, the number of possible structures grows exponentially with respect to the number of residues N.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Limitations of classical computation\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Classically, the search is performed using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations or Monte Carlo (MC) methods.\n",
    "   * In the MC method in particular, the procedure “compute energy difference ΔE → determine whether to accept the new structure using the classical Metropolis rule” is repeated.\n",
    "   * However, because many energy minima exist, classical searches tend to fall into local optima, and large-scale exploration is computationally difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Potential of quantum computation\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Quantum computers can make use of superposition (parallelism) and amplitude amplification.\n",
    "   * In particular, the Szegedy-type quantum walk is a quantized version of a classical Markov chain, and the paper shows the possibility of accelerating the Metropolis method. In other words, by representing local moves with a quantum walk, it is expected that the structure space can be explored more efficiently.\n"

    "In the proposed method, there is a classical processing part (Initialization module) that uses deep learning, and a quantum/classical Metropolis method (Simulation module) that executes quantum computation based on the obtained classical processing. The combination of this classical processing part and the quantum computation part is called QFold. The quantum computation part alone is referred to as the quantum Metropolis method. The quantum Metropolis method aims to perform an approximate exploration of the energy landscape by embedding an update rule similar to the Metropolis–Hastings method into a quantum circuit based on the Szegedy-type quantum walk.\n",
    "\n",
    "### - Classical processing [2]\n",
    "\n",
    "In QFold’s classical preprocessing, prior to executing the quantum computation, a finite set of φ–ψ angle configurations is sampled. For each configuration, using quantum chemistry software (e.g., **Psi4**), the **energy difference ΔE** in the transition from the current structure to the proposed structure is calculated and saved as a dataset. Through this process, the “stability” of each local structural change is provided as numerical values. However, in this notebook, classical processing is not performed; instead, the dataset already computed in [2] is used, and the focus is placed only on the quantum computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### - Quantum encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In the quantum encoding of the protein, the degrees of freedom of the structure are mapped onto qubits as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Rotation-angle qubits: encode the discretized angles φ and ψ\n",
    "* Move-id register: selects the dihedral angle to be updated\n",
    "* Coin qubit: encodes the Metropolis acceptance probability\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this correspondence, candidate protein structures are represented within the quantum circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### - Coin preparation and acceptance probability\n",
    "\n",
    "For each move, the acceptance probability is defined as\n",
    "$$\n",
    "A = \\min \\left( 1, e^{-\\beta \\Delta E} \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "(β is the inverse-temperature parameter). This probability is converted into the rotation angle\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\theta = 2 \\arcsin \\left( \\sqrt{A} \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "and Ry(θ) is applied to the coin qubit. As a result, low-energy structures are assigned higher amplitudes, and the transitions of the quantum walk are biased toward energetically favorable directions. Next, when the coin qubit is 1, the dihedral angle (φ or ψ) indicated by the move-id is updated. Afterwards, the auxiliary computation is uncomputed, and the reversibility of the entire operation is preserved. Furthermore, a **Grover-type reflection operator** is applied, and according to Szegedy’s quantization of the Markov chain, the amplitudes of the low-energy states are amplified through interference effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### - Measurement and interpretation of the results\n",
    "\n",
    "After repeating the walk operator for multiple steps, the φ and ψ registers are measured. Combinations that appear with high frequency in the measurement results correspond to low free-energy, stable folding structures.\n"
