    "# Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) for Solving Molecular Energies\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) is a key algorithm in quantum computing, allowing one to estimate the phase (or eigenvalue) of an eigenvector of a unitary operation. The algorithm is designed so, that for a given Hamiltonian $H$, and an eigenvalue ${|\\psi\\rangle}$, the output that will be obtained is $\\epsilon$ where\n",
    "\n",
    "$U{|\\psi\\rangle} = e^{2\\pi i\\epsilon}{|\\psi\\rangle} , U = e^{2\\pi iH}$ .\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, by measuring the phase accumulated, the QPE algorithm allows calculating the energies relating to the chosen initial state.\n",
    "When using QPE for chemistry problems, it is common to search for the lowest energy of a given molecule. As the molecule can be written in the form of a Hamiltonian (Hermitian matrix which meaning is the energetic forces of the structure), usually symbolized by \"H\", one only need to insert the ground eigenvector in order to obtain the minimal energy value using QPE. However, obtaining the ground state is not a trivial problem. In order to overcome it, it is sufficient to use a state with big overlap with the ground state.\n",
    "\n",
    "We define a state ${|v\\rangle}$ which will be chosen as the algorithm's initial state. Let us define {$\\psi_i$} to be the set of (unknown) eigenvalues of $H$. Generally, any vector can be rewritten as a superposition of any basis set, thus -\n",
    "\n",
    "${|v\\rangle} = \\sum_i a_i{|\\psi_i\\rangle}$\n",
    "\n",
    "and -\n",
    "\n",
    "$U{|v\\rangle} = \\sum_i a_i e^{2\\pi i\\epsilon_i}{|\\psi_i\\rangle}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "where ${\\epsilon_i}$ are the eigenvalues of H, i.e. the span of energies relating to the molecule. Using execution with enough shots, one will obtain this set of $\\theta_i$, i.e., a subset of the Hamiltonian's eigenvalues. As we are specifically interested in $\\epsilon_0$, the ground state of H, it is important that there is a large overlap between ${\\psi_0}$ and ${|v\\rangle}$ so the probability to measure ${\\epsilon_0}$ is high, i.e.\n",
    "\n",
    "$P(\\epsilon_0) = |\\langle v|\\psi_0\\rangle|^2 > \\epsilon $.\n",
    "\n",
    "How large is $\\epsilon$? After execution, we will obtain a set of ${E_i}$.\n",
    "If we have done 1000 shots of execution, and $P(\\epsilon_0)>1$, it should be measured is about 10 times to get a good statistical variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common choice for ${|v\\rangle}$ (the initial state) is the Hartree-Fock (HF) state, which with good probability have a large overlap with the ground state. However, other guesses for the initial state are possibly good or even better fit, and choosing the right initial state is a sort of art and an active field of research.\n",
    "\n",
    "For further reading about QPE we recommend [[1](#NC)].\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What are the benefits of using QPE algorithm for finding a molecule's ground state?\n",
    "\n",
    "The two most prominent methods to solve ground energy for molecules are quantum variational algorithm (VQE) and QPE. Those promise better scalability compared to classical counterparts as the molecules becomes more complex, with larger number of electrons manifesting as more degrees of freedom for the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "While so, the number of parameters in VQE is closely related to the number of electrons. This may create inherent difficulty achieving high-precision calculations through sampling statistical estimators, and paraphs even not converge for very large systems. While so, the number of parameters in QPE is a flexible value which is directly related to the resolution of the problem, but is not bonded with the number of electrons.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, it is known that advanced quantum algorithms based on QPE can perform electronic structure calculations in sub-exponential time with accuracy that rivals exact diagonalization methods. This guarantee of simultaneously achieving high accuracy, efficiency, and generality is a feat that is believed to be impossible for classical algorithms. For those reasons, VQE is applicable in the near term (NISQ) era, while QPE is suited for fault-tolerant design.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### During this tutorial, we will follow the QPE algorithms steps as following:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. Define a molecule and convert it into a Hamiltonian H, manifested as a pauli list.\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Prepare the Hamiltonian for QPE: including normalization and choosing the resolution.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Initializing the state for the HF state.\n",
    "\n",
    "d. Preparing the quantum circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "e. Executing the circuit to find the related phases and analyzing the results to find the ground state.\n",
    "\n",
    "f. Comparing the QPE results with exact solution for the molecule’s ground state."

In order to do so we use rough estimation of the absolute max value that can take place by adding together all the pauli coefficients and multiplying by the matrix's dimensions.
