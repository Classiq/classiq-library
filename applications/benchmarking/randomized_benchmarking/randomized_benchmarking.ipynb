    "# Randomized Benchmarking\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook explains how to perform a full, end-to-end, randomized benchmarking (RB) experiment using the Classiq platform. The notebook is divided into several parts describing the different steps of the workflow: model definition, synthesis, execution, and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1) Model Definition\n",
    "Start by defining the model, then the high-level function and its constraints:\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Define the parameters of the problem. In this case, five FunctionParams objects correspond to five different models. This part is hardware-unaware.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Define hardware settings for the problem. These are the basis gates necessary for execution on IBM Quantum machines, which you do later.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Create models from the results of the previous steps, adding width, depth, and other constraints. Specifically for RB, `num_of_qubits` determines the width and `num_of_cliffords` determines the depth. The synthesis engine does not make use of these constraints, and they are omitted."

    "When you have the programs you are ready to run. Classiq allows running multiple programs on multiple backends in a single command. You specify the hardware (see details in the [executor user guide](https://docs.classiq.io/latest/user-guide/execution/index.html ) ). This example runs on IBM Quantum simulators but may be replaced by any hardware with the proper access credentials. For IBM Quantum hardware access, for example, replace `ibmq_access_t` with an API token from [IBMQ's website](https://quantum-computing.ibm.com/) and specify the hardware name in the `backend_name` field of the `BackendPreferences` objects."

Then, reorder the data according to the hardware, calling the `RBAnalysis` class to present the hardware comparison histograms.\n",
