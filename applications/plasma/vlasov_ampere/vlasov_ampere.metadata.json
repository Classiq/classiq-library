  "description": "This demonstration was created in collaboration with the authors of the paper on encoding linear kinetic plasma problems in quantum circuits. It explores solving a linearized kinetic model of plasma (simplified Vlasov\u2013Amp\u00e8re system in one spatial dimension) using QSVT. The block-encoding of the classical matrix for spatial and velocity phase space is implemented with controlled operations and quantum arithmetic; Qmod enables a well-structured implementation linking the matrix to the circuit.",
