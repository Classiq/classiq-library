  "description": "This notebook describes how to create multi-controlled X (MCX) gates with Classiq, including a 14-control example and a 50-control example. It shows that specifying MCX at a high level lets the synthesis engine optimize for depth, width, or other constraints, preparing circuits for current and future hardware.",
