  "description": "This notebook is a step-by-step example of solving a small optimization problem with Classiq. You define the problem in Pyomo, convert it to a quantum model via the combinatorial optimization application, and run QAOA on a simulator. The goal is to learn the workflow so you can tackle more complex problems.",
