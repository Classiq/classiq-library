    "\n",
    "The simple model above demonstrates several features that are essential in every Qmod code:\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `@qfunc` Decorator\n",
    "Qmod is a quantum programming language embedded in Python. The decorator `@qfunc` designates a quantum function, so that it can be processed by the Qmod tool chain. The Python function is executed at a later point to construct the Qmod representation. This decorator is used for every Qmod function definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function `main`\n",
    "A complete Qmod model, that is, a description that can be synthesized and executed, must define a function called `main`. Function `main` is the quantum entry point - it specifies the inputs and outputs of the quantum program, that is, its interface with the external classical execution logic. Similar to conventional programming languages, function `main`, can call other functions.\n",
    "Output variables that are declared in `main` definition are the ones to be measured when the program is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working with Quantum Variables\n",
    "Quantum objects are representations of data (boolean values, numbers, arrays of numbers and so on), that are stored in specific qubits.\n",
    "In Qmod, quantum objects are handled and manipulated using __quantum variables__. Quantum variables must be declared and initialized explicitly.\n",
    "The model above demonstrates two important kinds of declaration:\n",
    "-  Function `foo` declares parameter `q` thus: `q: QBit`. This declaration means `foo` expects a pre-existing quantum object.\n",
    "-  Function `main` declares parameter `q` thus: `q: Output[QBit]`. In this case, `q` is an output-only parameter - it is initialized inside the scope of `main`.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Prior to their initialization, local quantum variables and output parameters do not reference any object (this is analogous to null reference in conventional languages). They may be initialized in the following ways:\n",
    "- Using [`allocate`](https://docs.classiq.io/latest/qmod-reference/api-reference/operations/?h=allocate#classiq.qmod.builtins.operations.allocate) to initialize the variable to a new object, with all its qubits in the default $|0\\rangle$ state.\n",
    "- Using [numeric assignment](https://docs.classiq.io/latest/qmod-reference/language-reference/statements/numeric-assignment/) to initialize the variable to an object representing the result of a quantum expression.\n",
    "- Using functions with output parameters (for example, [state preparation](https://docs.classiq.io/latest/qmod-reference/library-reference/core-library-functions/prepare_state_and_amplitudes/prepare_state_and_amplitudes/)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: all the variables in `main` must be declared as `Output`, as `main` is the entry point of the model (Think about it: where could a variable be initialized before `main` was called?). Other functions can declare parameters with or without the `Output` modifier.\n",
