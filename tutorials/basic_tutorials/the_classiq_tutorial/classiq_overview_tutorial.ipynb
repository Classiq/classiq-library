    "\n",
    "Having said that, we have no choice but to run multiple times (many more than $2^3$ in our case) to make sure that we measure all `x`s of interest. A classical computer could obtain the same information in exactly $2^3$ runs.\n",

    "Then, why bother?\n",
    "\n",

For example, it is widely used in oracle functions within Grover’s search algorithm and in quantum cryptographic protocols."
