  "description": "This notebook simulates a discrete-time quantum walk on a complex network (graph). The graph is built with NetworkX; the walk uses a position register and a coin register, with coin and shift operators applied each step. The result is a probability distribution over nodes, illustrating graph-based quantum walk construction in Qmod.",
