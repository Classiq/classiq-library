    "Quantum computing is based on the principles of quantum mechanics, which includes an important feature: unitarity. The operations we are able to execute in  a quantum circuit are unitary.  Would this mean that problems requiring non-unitary operations are out of hand for quantum computers? This is the task solved by the Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU) algorithm [[1](#childs_paper), [2](#childs_notes)]. Lets dive in more details about what can be done with this algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a non-unitary matrix $A$ that can be decomposed into\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    A = \\sum_{i=0}^{2^n-1} \\alpha_i U_i,\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\alpha_i$ are real, positive coefficients and $U_i$ are unitary matrices. The LCU algorithm can execute the action of $A$, up to a normalization factor, in a subspace of a bigger quantum circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way LCU do this is by using auxiliary (control) qubits to project the operation given by $A$, up to normalization. The first step of the LCU is to prepare the state on the auxiliary qubits using the function PREPARE:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    |\\psi_0\\rangle = PREPARE|0\\rangle = \\sum_i \\sqrt{\\frac{\\alpha_i}{\\lambda}}|i\\rangle,\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\lambda = \\sum_i |\\alpha_i|$ is a normalization factor. After that, the control qubits are entangled with the target qubits with the SELECT operation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    SELECT|i\\rangle|\\psi\\rangle = |i\\rangle U_i |\\psi\\rangle,\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $|\\psi\\rangle$ is a general quantum state. The final step is to have the PREPARE operation reversed. This way, the quantum circuit has the following effect on the qubits:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    LCU|0\\rangle|\\psi\\rangle = PREPARE^{-1}\\, SELECT\\, PREPARE |0\\rangle|\\psi\\rangle = V |0\\rangle |\\psi\\rangle,\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where V can be represented as\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V = \\begin{bmatrix}A & \\cdot \\\\ \\cdot & \\cdot \\end{bmatrix}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called the Block Encoding of the matrix A. This way, if we project the control qubits in the $|0\\rangle$ state, we would obtain\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\left(|0\\rangle\\langle0|\\otimes I\\right)LCU|0\\rangle|\\phi\\rangle = |0\\rangle\\frac{A}{\\lambda}|\\psi\\rangle.\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, the action of the sequence of operations over the target qubit will be the non-unitary operation $A$, up to a normalization factor. A more detailed mathematical description of the circuit can be seen below and in [[1](#childs_paper)]. It is also important to notice that the projection onto the $|0\\rangle$ state depends on a success probability, detailed in [[1]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1202.5822). Overall, the general circuit of the LCU would look like this:"
