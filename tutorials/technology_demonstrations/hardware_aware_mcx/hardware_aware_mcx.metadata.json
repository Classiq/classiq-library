  "description": "This notebook shows that the same multi-controlled X (MCX) specification yields different circuits when targeting different hardware. It uses custom hardware settings: two fictitious backends with the same basis (cx, u) but different connectivity (linear vs all-to-all), illustrating hardware-aware synthesis.",
