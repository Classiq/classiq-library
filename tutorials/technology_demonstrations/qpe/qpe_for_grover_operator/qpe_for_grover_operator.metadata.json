  "description": "This notebook demonstrates Classiq's QPE applied to a Grover operator, which is the core of amplitude estimation. A toy model is used: a Grover operator for a chosen good state on 5 qubits. It shows how to build the model and use the built-in qpe function for eigenvalue estimation.",
