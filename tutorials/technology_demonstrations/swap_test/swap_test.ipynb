    "# Swap Test Tutorial\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The swap test is a quantum computing technique used to determine the similarity between two quantum states. It plays a crucial role in quantum information processing, enabling the measurement of the overlap between states without directly observing their contents. This tutorial covers the importance, utility, applications, and operation of the swap test in quantum computing. This tutorial also showcases the powerful abstractions provide by the Classiq platform and SDK, highlighting how Classiq makes quantum algorithm design, development, prototyping, and testing streamlined. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Why It's Important\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum computing operates on the principles of quantum mechanics, leveraging superposition and entanglement to perform computations that are infeasible for classical computers. The swap test is important for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **State Comparison**: It provides a means to compare quantum states without collapsing their superpositions, preserving the quantum information.\n",
    "- **Entanglement Detection**: Helps in detecting entanglement, a key resource in quantum computing and communication.\n",
    "- **Quantum Algorithms**: Integral to the implementation of various quantum algorithms, enhancing their efficiency and applicability.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How It's Useful\n",
    "\n",
    "The swap test is useful in a variety of quantum computing tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Quantum Machine Learning**: In algorithms that require measuring the distance or similarity between vectors (states), such as clustering and classification.\n",
    "- **Quantum Chemistry**: For comparing molecular states in simulations, aiding in the understanding of chemical reactions at the quantum level.\n",
    "- **Quantum Cryptography**: In protocols where verifying the integrity of quantum states is necessary, ensuring secure communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Where It's Useful\n",
    "\n",
    "Applications of the swap test span across multiple domains, demonstrating its versatility:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Algorithmic Benchmarking**: Testing and comparing the performance of quantum algorithms in solving specific problems.\n",
    "- **Quantum Error Correction**: Assessing the fidelity of quantum error correction codes by comparing corrected states against ideal states.\n",
    "- **Entanglement Verification**: In experimental setups to verify the presence and degree of entanglement between quantum systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Swap Test\n",
    "\n",
    "The swap test algorithm operates by creating an interference pattern to measure the overlap between two quantum states. Here's a simplified explanation of its operation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Preparation**: Two quantum states $|\\psi\\rangle$ and $|\\phi\\rangle$ are prepared, whose similarity is to be tested.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Ancilla Qubit**: An additional qubit (ancilla) is initialized in the state $|0\\rangle$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hadamard Operation**: A Hadamard gate is applied to the ancilla qubit, putting it into a superposition state of $\\frac{|0\\rangle + |1\\rangle}{\\sqrt{2}}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Controlled Swap**: A controlled swap (Fredkin gate) operation is performed between the two quantum states, conditioned on the state of the ancilla qubit.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Second Hadamard**: Another Hadamard gate is applied to the ancilla qubit.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Measurement**: The ancilla qubit is measured. The probability of finding it in the state $|0\\rangle$ is related to the overlap (similarity) between the states $|\\psi\\rangle$ and $|\\phi\\rangle$.<br><br>\n",
