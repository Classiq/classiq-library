  "description": "This notebook demonstrates synthesis of a discrete quantum walk on a circle: a walk operator acts on a coin qubit and a position QNum, with the core step implemented as a series of multi-controlled X operations. It compares Classiq synthesis with Qiskit transpilation across a range of qubit counts.",
