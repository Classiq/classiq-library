  "description": "This tutorial shows automatic auxiliary-qubit management by the synthesis engine. A state preparation built from multi-controlled rotations is synthesized under a global width constraint; the engine initializes and reuses auxiliary qubits across blocks to reduce depth. Custom hardware settings (e.g. basis gates) can be applied.",
