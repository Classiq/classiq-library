    "Qiskit, as we know is designed to be a python SDK for quantum programming, which start with qubits and functions which aggregate these qubits with logical quantum gates to build quantum circuits. Classiq on the other hand offers an advantage of designing quantum algorithms without being tied to circuits. How? By using a higher-level functional design. In Classiq, quantum algorithms can be built using functions which contain native primitives and datatypes like QNum and QArray, which all then culminate in a main function. In addition to its python SDK, Classiq offers a native language, QMod which is how our quantum algorithm written in python connects with the easy-to-use visual Classiq platform for synthesis, optimization, analysis, and execution. This in turn also offers quantum experts flexible design and deep optimization of quantum programs for specific implementations."

    "Phase Kickback is quantum primitive of high importance, used in larger quantum algorithms, e.g., Shor’s, Simon’s, Deutsch-Josza, and Grover’s. It deals with kicking the result of a function to the phase of a quantum state so it can be smartly manipulated with constructive and destructive interferences to achieve the desired result. This means that a phase shift applied to a control qubit during a controlled operation is \"kicked back\" to the control qubit."

The purpose of the oracle here is to check if the state of each of these qubits is $|0\\rangle$ using a fliping mechanism using $pauli X$ gate for the zero state detection. This is followed by the usage of the multi-controlled Toffoli gate which flips the target qubit only when all control qubits are in a specific state, in this case $|0\\rangle$ after which the x qubits are flipped back before measurement."
