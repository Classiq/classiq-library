    "To implement the Hadamard test algorithm with a unitary $U$ and target state $|{\\psi}\\rangle$ as inputs and control-qubit probabilities as the outputs, a Hadamard gate $H$ is first applied to place the control qubit in a uniform superposition $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\big(|{0}\\rangle|{\\psi}\\rangle+|{1}\\rangle|{\\psi}\\rangle\\big)$. Next, a controlled unitary gate is applied to the target qubit array, resulting in the state $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\big(|{0}\\rangle|{\\psi}\\rangle+|{1}\\rangle U|{\\psi}\\rangle\\big)$.
