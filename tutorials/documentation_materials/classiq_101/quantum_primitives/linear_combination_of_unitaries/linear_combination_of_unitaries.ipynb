    "Quantum computing is based on the principles of quantum mechanics, which includes an important feature: unitarity. The operations that evolve quantum states on quantum computers are unitary.  Would this mean that problems requiring non-unitary operations are out of hand for quantum computers? This is the task solved by the Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU) algorithm [[1](#childs_paper), [2](#childs_notes)]. \n",

    "Given a non-unitary matrix $A$ that can be decomposed into a sum of unitary matrices as follows:\n",

    "    A = \\sum_{i=0}^{2^n-1} \\alpha_i U_i,\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\alpha_i$ are real, positive coefficients and $U_i$ are unitary matrices, the LCU algorithm applies the action of $A$, up to a normalization factor, on a desired quantum state. \n",
    "\n",
    "It does so by embedding the matrix $A$ in a bigger unitary. The first step of the LCU is to prepare the following state on an auxiliary quantum register according to the coefficients $\\alpha_i$ using the function PREPARE:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    |\\psi_0\\rangle = PREPARE|0\\rangle = \\sum_i \\sqrt{\\frac{\\alpha_i}{\\lambda}}|i\\rangle,\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\lambda = \\sum_i |\\alpha_i|$ is a normalization factor. This quantum register with the prepared state is used as a controller for the next step. Then, according to the controller quantum register, the following state is being prepared:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    SELECT|i\\rangle|\\psi\\rangle = |i\\rangle U_i |\\psi\\rangle,\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",

    "where $|\\psi\\rangle$ is the desired quantum state the matrix $A$ should be applied on. The final step is to have the PREPARE operation inversed such that the following desired state is created: \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    LCU|0\\rangle|\\psi\\rangle = PREPARE^{-1}\\, SELECT\\, PREPARE |0\\rangle|\\psi\\rangle = V |0\\rangle |\\psi\\rangle,\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $V$ can be represented as\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$V = \\begin{bmatrix}A & \\cdot \\\\ \\cdot & \\cdot \\end{bmatrix}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called the Block Encoding of the matrix A. By projecting the controller quantum register on the $|0\\rangle$ state the desired outcome is obtained:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\left(|0\\rangle\\langle0|\\otimes I\\right)LCU|0\\rangle|\\phi\\rangle = |0\\rangle\\frac{A}{\\lambda}|\\psi\\rangle.\n",
