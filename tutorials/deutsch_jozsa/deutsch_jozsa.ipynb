    "* Boolean Function: A mathematical function whose inputs and outputs assume values from a binary or two-element set of the fashion {True, False} or {0,1} and is of the form $f: \\{0,1\\}^k \\to \\{0,1\\}$ where k is any non-negative integer.\n",
    "\n",

    "Interestingly, DJ was the first quantum algorithm to \"theoretically\" demonstrate an exponential speedup over its determiniatic classical counterpart <a href=\"doi:10.1098/rspa.1998.0164\">[2]</a>. This is because the classical solution neccessitates the need to evaluate atleast more than half the inputs to determine whether the given $f(x)$ is balanced whereas in the quantum solution, we only need to evaluate the $f(x)$ once, exploiting the concept of quantum superposition.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the classical solution, the approach is to query the oracle multiple times. To understand the magnitude of inefficiency in such an approach, let's consider the worst case scenario. Let's say that on investigating our outputs for each of the multiple queries to the oracle, we will need to check that exactly half of all possible inputs plus one to be certain that the function is constant, which is essentially an exhaustive or brute-force search that we end up performing. This is because if the function is not constant, you will encounter a different output by the time you have tested half the inputs plus one.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, the quantum solution boils down the solution to only one single query.The quantum solution does this by leveraging the parallelism that superposition provides to investigate the outputs for each given input to see whether the output is same irrespective of anything (constant) or whether there are equal number of two possible binary outputs. The parallelism helps us treat the problem as simply the evaluation of $f(x)$ at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although there are a few known, accepted implementations, its beauty lies in the that it can be carried out in 5 steps, which we will detail in the Guided Implementation below. We start out with choosing a predicate that'll act as our function condition for our oracle. Our initial setup consists of n qubits and one ancilla qubit in the state $|0\\rangle$. Two of our key components are putting our n qubits into a superposition of all possible inputs of the function using hadamard transform and an oracle constructed to represent our query, or in simple words the given function $f(x)$.\n",
