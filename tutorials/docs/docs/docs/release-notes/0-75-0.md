Released on 2025-04-08.

## Upgrade Instructions

-   [Python SDK](../classiq_101/registration_installations.md/#platform-version-updates)
-   The IDE upgrades automatically.

## Classiq Studio Updates

Added a new command `reset-user-env` to reset the virtual environment to its default state
helping resolve dependency issues and clean up installations.

## Classiq IDE

Added a "User Terms" button inside the IDE website at the bottom of the screen, and clicking on it opens a modal displaying our user terms.

## Enhancements

When estimating using the `ClassiqSimulatorBackendNames.SIMULATOR_STATEVECTOR` backend,
whether using the `ExecutionSession` or classical main, compute the expectation
value directly from the state vector instead of running shots.
