Released on 2024-12-23.

## Upgrade Instructions

-   [Python SDK](../classiq_101/registration_installations.md/#platform-version-updates)
-   The IDE upgrades automatically.

## Enhancements

1. [Generative functions](https://docs.classiq.io/latest/qmod-reference/language-reference/generative-functions/)
   have undergone a round of significant improvements.
   Check out our [DQI notebook](https://docs.classiq.io/latest/explore/algorithms/dqi/dqi_max_xorsat/)
   to see how generative functions are used to implement advanced quantum algorithms.
2. A new filed `optimization_level` has been added the `Preferences` of the synthesis.
   This field determines the trade-off between synthesis speed and the quality of the results,
   In terms of the optimization parameter and the constraints. For more information,
   see [here](../user-guide/synthesis/preferences.md/#optimization-level).
3. State vector filtering is available. This is an important step for simulating
   large circuits with a state vector simulator. For more information, see [this page](../user-guide/execution/state-vector-filtering.md)

## Bug Fixes

1. Fix usage of overlapping quantum array slices (e.g., `qbv[1:3]` and `qbv[2]`)
   in bodies of lambda expressions and control statements.
