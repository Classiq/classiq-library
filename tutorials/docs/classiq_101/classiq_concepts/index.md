# Classiq Concepts

Classiq allows you to design, optimize, analyze, and execute quantum programs. This section covers how to do all these with Classiq.

The first subsection, [Design](./design), explains the fundamentals of the Qmod language via concrete examples.

[Optimize](./optimize) covers how to optimize the quantum algorithms written in Qmod using Classiq.

[Analyze](./analyze) guides you in analyzing the optimized quantum program to understand it better and perhaps debug it.

[Execute](./execute) describes how to smoothly execute quantum programs on simulators and real quantum computers.
