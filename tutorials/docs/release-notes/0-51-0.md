Released on 2024-09-29.

## Upgrade Instructions

-   [Python SDK](../classiq_101/registration_installations.md/#platform-version-updates)
-   The IDE upgrades automatically.

## Notice

-   With the release of version `0.52` (scheduled for the week of 06-12.10.2024),
    execution with older SDK versions might result in errors or unexpected behavior.
    In order to make sure executions of your quantum programs via the SDK work properly
    upgrade your SDK to the latest version (See instructions guide above).

## Enhancements

1. Improve qubit reuse in arithmetic operations when `machine_precision` is set.
2. Improve error messages when executing circuits on Amazon Braket.
3. Improve error messages when executing the VQE primitive.
4. Support constant assignments: `x |= 3`, `x ^= 3`, and `x += 3`.

## Bug Fixes

1. Fix in-place XOR assignments (`^=`) of 1-qubit expressions into multi-qubit
   variables (used to raise an error).

## SDK

1. Add a new function, `quantum_program_from_qasm`, to convert a QASM string into a Quantum Program.
