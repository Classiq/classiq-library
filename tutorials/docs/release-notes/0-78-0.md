Released on 2025-05-05.

## Upgrade Instructions

-   [Python SDK](../classiq_101/registration_installations.md/#platform-version-updates)
-   The IDE upgrades automatically.

## Enhancements

1. A new `IQAE` application has been added to the SDK. It allows you to define `iqae` problems in terms of Qmod function,
   and directly estimate the amplitude of the state you prepared.

    [IQAE application Descriptions](../sdk-reference/applications/IQAE.md)

    It is recommended to use this application in `iqae` problems, rather than `cmain`
    with the primitive `iqae`.

## Bug Fixes

1. Fixed an issue where the “Basic” view was always empty; it now correctly renders the circuit as intended.
2. Fixed bugs causing several example models to not be supported in the "New" circuit visualization, including "Shor's Algorithm Modular Exponentiation".
