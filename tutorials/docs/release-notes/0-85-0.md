### New Feature: QP Visualization Enhancements

The Classiq IDE now includes an improved QP visualization feature. Controlled functions are displayed in transparent boxes blocks, where:

-   The transparent section represents the control mechanism.
-   The filled block highlights the controlled function.

This enhancement provides a clearer and more intuitive representation of quantum programs, making it easier to understand and debug complex circuits.
