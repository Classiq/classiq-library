Released on 2025-04-28.

## Upgrade Instructions

-   [Python SDK](../classiq_101/registration_installations.md/#platform-version-updates)
-   The IDE upgrades automatically.

## Enhancements

1. In Qmod's Python embedding, you can now declare quantum functions with classical parameters
   of Python builtin types such as `int`, `float`, and `list`. These variables can be
   used in expressions that require Python values, such as Python `for` loops and 3rd party
   library functions, as is shown in the example below. See more on this under the new
   reference page on
   [Generative Descriptions](../qmod-reference/language-reference/generative-descriptions.md)

    [comment]: DO_NOT_TEST

    ```python
    @qfunc
    def rotate(ratio: float, qa: QArray[QBit]):
        for i in range(qa.len):  # 'qa.len' is a Python integer
            PHASE(math.asin(ratio * i), qa[i])  # 'ratio * i' evaluates to a Python float
    ```

## Interface Changes

1. With _Enhancement 1_ described above, Python-type parameters supersede classical Qmod-type parameters
   in generative functions. Hence, the use of the function decorator `@qfunc(generative=True)`
   is no longer required. Qmod-type parameters are treated symbolically in Python, and their
   use in Python expressions is deprecated.

## Classiq IDE

1. Improved UX in Quantum program visualization: collapsing a Quantum operation block will scroll the viewport into the parent operation block position
