Released on 2025-02-02.

## Upgrade Instructions

-   [Python SDK](../classiq_101/registration_installations.md/#platform-version-updates)
-   The IDE upgrades automatically.

## Enhancements

1. Unreleased local variables of a function are now un-computed
   and released when calling the function under a _compute_ block of a
   [Within-apply](../qmod-reference/language-reference/statements/within-apply.md)
   statement.

## Bug Fixes

1. Fix control optimization for constant equality conditions
   (e.g., `control(x == 1, ...)`) producing wrong circuits under certain
   conditions.
2. Fix in-place XOR optimization for classical values (e.g., `x ^= -0.5`)
   producing wrong circuits under certain conditions.
3. Fix in-place XOR optimization for Boolean expressions
   (e.g., `x ^= (y > 0) & (z > 0)`) producing wrong circuits under certain
   conditions.
4. Fix a bug causing an internal error in arithmetic expression that use comparison,
   subtraction, or negation (e.g. `x > 0.3`, `0.2 - x`, `-x`) when synthesizing
   models with the machine precision set to higher than 8.
