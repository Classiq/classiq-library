Released on 2024-12-10.

## Upgrade Instructions

-   [Python SDK](../classiq_101/registration_installations.md/#platform-version-updates)
-   The IDE upgrades automatically.

## Bug Fixes

1. Operands' list elements can be used as operands (in expressions such as,
   e.g., `[op_list[0]]`).

## Library Additions

1. Add a demonstration of the Decoded Quantum Interferometry (DQI) algorithm. See [notebook](../../explore/algorithms/dqi/dqi_max_xorsat/).
2. Add the function `qsvt_lcu` for efficiently encoding QSVT polynomials with indefinite parity.
3. Subsequent invocations to execution primitives inside `ExecutionSession`
   now use different random seeds (depending on the initial seed) to avoid
   getting the exact same simulation results inside a session.

## IDE Improvements

### New Visualization:

1. Clean up variable names in engine blocks.
