Released on 2025-05-19.

## Upgrade Instructions

-   [Python SDK](../classiq_101/registration_installations.md/#platform-version-updates)
-   The IDE upgrades automatically.

### Enhancements

1. Value range analysis of arithmetic expressions is now generalized to apply
   across statements, optimizing quantum variables sizes and arithmetic expressions
   implementation in more cases.

2. Quantum functions inside a control statement get a `c-` prefix

3. Added the functions `prepare_dicke_state` and `prepare_dicke_state_unary_input`.

4. A new exponentiation function, [sparse_suzuki_trotter](../qmod-reference/api-reference/functions/core_library/exponentiation.md/#classiq.qmod.builtins.functions.exponentiation.sparse_suzuki_trotter),
   has been added to the core library, performing Suzuki-Trotter decomposition using a sparse representation
   of the Hamiltonian. It is recommended to use this function instead of `suzuki_trotter` when you handle a sparse Hamiltonian, as it is more efficient.

5. Include `classiq.execution` in the top level `classiq` package in the SDK.

    Old:

    ```
    from classiq.execution import ExecutionPreferences
    ```

    New:

    ```
    from classiq import ExecutionPreferences
    ```

6. [`allocate`](../qmod-reference/api-reference/operations.md/#classiq.qmod.builtins.operations.allocate) now
   supports specifying numeric attributes of the allocated variable.
