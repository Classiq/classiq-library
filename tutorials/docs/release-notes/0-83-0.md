Released on 2025-06-09.

## Upgrade Instructions

-   [Python SDK](../classiq_101/registration_installations.md/#platform-version-updates)
-   The IDE upgrades automatically.

## Enhancements

-   Added the concatenation operator to Qmod. This operator packs a sequence of
    quantum variables (or their parts) into a qubit array. For example,
    `hadamard_transform([my_qnum, my_qarray[1:3]])` passes an array of the
    respective qubits to the function. See more under
    [concatenation operator](https://docs.classiq.io/latest/qmod-reference/language-reference/quantum-variables/#concatenation-operator).

-   Width constraints are now treated more systematically for optimization
    levels 0-2 (partitioning the model into separate synthesis steps), yielding
    solutions in cases where previously no solution was found. See more under
    [Optimization Level](../user-guide/synthesis/preferences.md/#optimization-level).

## Interface Changes

-   The type `SerailizedQuantumProgram` and method `QuantumProgram.get_qprog` are no longer available.
