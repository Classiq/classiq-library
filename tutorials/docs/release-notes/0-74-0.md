Released on 2025-03-31.

## Upgrade Instructions

-   [Python SDK](../classiq_101/registration_installations.md/#platform-version-updates)
-   The IDE upgrades automatically.

## Interface Changes

1. The functions `construct_qsvm_model`, `construct_finance_model`, and
   `construct_grover_model` have been removed from the SDK.
   Check out our Qmod implementations of the QSVM, finance, and Grover
   algorithms on the [Classiq library](https://github.com/Classiq/classiq-library).

### Enhancements

-   `QuantumProgram` objects have been optimized to be significantly leaner, improving performance across all actions that handle them.
-   Visualizing Quantum Programs is now significantly faster.
-   Added the functions `prepare_complex_amplitudes` and `inplace_prepare_complex_amplitudes`.

##### Quantum Program Visualization

-   Auto-expand QMOD statements without expressions (e.g. `power`).
    ![plot](./resources/images/power_expanded_example.png "expanded power commmand")
-   Statements with quantum expressions now display their corresponding expression directly on the block.
