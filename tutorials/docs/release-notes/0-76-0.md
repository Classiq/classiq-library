Released on 2025-04-21.

## Upgrade Instructions

-   [Python SDK](../classiq_101/registration_installations.md/#platform-version-updates)
-   The IDE upgrades automatically.

## Enhancements

1. It is now legal to [out-of-place assign](../qmod-reference/language-reference/statements/numeric-assignment.md#out-of-place-assignment)
   to a variable whose declared size is larger than the minimal size required to
   fit the range of possible expression values.

## Interface Changes

1. The function `synthesize` now returns an object of type `QuantumProgram`, and its fields can be accessed directly.
   The type `SerailizedQuantumProgram` and method `QuantumProgram.get_qprog` are no longer needed, they are deprecated and will be removed in a future version.

2. Email Service Update - We've replaced the Community button with a new
   dropdown menu.
   Users can now select "Contact Us", which opens a form.
   Once the form is submitted with user details, an email is sent directly to Classiq.

3. Layout Fixes - Resolved an issue with inconsistent padding across the layout to ensure a cleaner, more polished UI.

4. Enhanced Sharing Options - In addition to existing platforms, users can now share content to LinkedIn and Reddit with a single click.
