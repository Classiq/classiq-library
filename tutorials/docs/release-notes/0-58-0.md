Released on 2024-11-18.

## Upgrade Instructions

-   [Python SDK](../classiq_101/registration_installations.md/#platform-version-updates)
-   The IDE upgrades automatically.

## Enhancements

1. This release introduces a new version to the Quantum Program (QP) visualization tool in parallel to the legacy visualization.
2. The new visualization version offers advanced visualization capabilities that bridge high-level algorithmic descriptions (Qmod) with gate-level implementations, incorporating interactive hierarchical views and data flow analysis.

### Feature Details

#### Visualization Versions:

Both the new version and the legacy version are available on the Quantum Program page.
Users can toggle between two visualization versions:

-   'New' version: Advanced visualization that includes quantum data flow views and new hierarchical block structures.
-   'Basic' version: Legacy visualization.

#### Documentation & Support:

[Initial documentation](../user-guide/analysis/quantum-program-visualization-tool/new-version.md) : A basic guide is available to help users navigate and utilize the visualization tool’s key features.

Tooltip: Integrated to the QP page to provide in-line initial guidance on key functions and elements.

#### Known Issues and Limitations:

Supported models: The 'New' visualization doesn't yet support all models. Unsupported models may not render - in these cases it is suggested to switch back to the 'Basic' visualization.

In-Progress development: This is part of an initial release milestone, with major issues being actively addressed.

#### Usage Recommendations

Switching between versions: It’s recommended to switch between the 'New' and 'Basic' versions to evaluate visualization consistency and effectiveness for specific quantum programs.

Feedback and bug reporting: Any issues, inconsistencies, or suggested improvements should be reported through the designated Slack channel for prompt review.

#### Next Steps

User feedback will inform ongoing improvements and prepare the tool for broader production release. Further enhancements and bug fixes are planned in alignment with Classiq’s high-level quantum design roadmap.
