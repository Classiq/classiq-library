Released on 2025-07-28.

## Upgrade Instructions

-   [Python SDK](../classiq_101/registration_installations.md/#platform-version-updates)
-   The IDE upgrades automatically.

## Enhancements

-   [Concatenations](https://docs.classiq.io/latest/qmod-reference/language-reference/quantum-variables/#concatenation-operator)
    can now also be used as [control](https://docs.classiq.io/latest/qmod-reference/language-reference/statements/control/)
    expressions.
-   Added the functions `lcu` and `lcu_pauli` for creating the Linear Combination of Unitaries primitive (LCU).
-   IBM Cloud is now available. See [Cloud Providers](https://docs.classiq.io/latest/user-guide/execution/cloud-providers/) section in the user guide.
-   The default optimization level in the synthesis preferences has been changed from `OptimizationLevel.HIGH` (3)
    to `OptimizationLevel.LIGHT` (1). For more information about optimization level
    see the [optimization level](https://docs.classiq.io/latest/user-guide/synthesis/preferences/#optimization-level) section in the user guide.

## Fixes

## Bug Fixes

-   Fix a synthesis bug that causes, in some cases, the function under power to have
    a separate power for each function, instead of sharing it as a whole.
-   Fix a failure in hardware-aware synthesis of parametric models for the
    `Azure Quantum` provider.
-   Fix a bug in `get_hf_state` when using qubit tapering.

## Visualization

### Introducing "Variables View"

A new compact visualization mode that displays quantum variable flow at a higher level perspective. Toggle between this streamlined view and the traditional qubit grid overlay using the Variables View switch in the visualization menu bar.‚Äù

## Classiq Studio

### Memory monitor

A new memory monitoring feature that tracks and displays resource usage during Classiq Studio Usage, providing real-time insights into memory consumption patterns.
