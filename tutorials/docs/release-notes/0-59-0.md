Released on 2024-11-25.

## Upgrade Instructions

-   [Python SDK](../classiq_101/registration_installations.md/#platform-version-updates)
-   The IDE upgrades automatically.

## Enhancements

1. Allow different parts of a quantum struct or array to be passed in different
   sections of a quantum statement:

    [comment]: DO_NOT_TEST

    ```python
    @qfunc
    def main() -> None:
        qbv = QArray("qbv")
        allocate(2, qbv)
        # The following line previously raised an exception, but is now valid
        control(qbv[0], lambda: H(qbv[1]))
    ```

## Deprecations

1. Using `control` as a keyword parameter for standard gates (such as `CX`) is
   no longer supported. Use `ctrl` instead.
