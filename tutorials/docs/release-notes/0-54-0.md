Released on 2024-10-21.

## Upgrade Instructions

-   [Python SDK](../classiq_101/registration_installations.md/#platform-version-updates)
-   The IDE upgrades automatically.

## Deprecations

1. Python 3.8 is no longer supported in the Python SDK. The minimum supported
   version is now Python 3.9.

## Enhancements

1. Optimize in-place XOR variable assignments (`x ^= y`).
   (The implementation no longer uses auxiliary qubits.)
2. Improve error messages in `CArray` (array) parameter declaration.
3. Support array subscripts and struct field access on the left-hand side of
   in-place arithmetic assignments (`qbv[0] ^= 1` and `my_Struct.field += 2.5`).
4. Optimize the controlled version of QFT arithmetic implementations by skipping
   controlling the QFT and QFT dagger.
