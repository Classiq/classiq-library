    "Quantum variables and operations lie at the heart of the Qmod language but they are not enough for designing all quantum algorithms. To complete the picture, you may need to perform classical control flow with classical operations over classical variables. Typical Python operations include `for` loops and `if-else` statements over `int` or `float` variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Qmod, equivalent types for the common Python `int`, `float`, and `bool` types are denoted by `int`, `real`, and `bool` in the native syntax and by `CInt`, `CReal`, and `CBool` in the Python SDK. In addition, arrays of classical values are also supported as well as more configurable data structures called `Struct`s (which are the equivalent of Python dataclasses without methods). See the full list of [classical variables and types supported in Qmod](https://docs.classiq.io/latest/reference-manual/qmod/language-reference/classical-types/#structs). \n",
    "\n",
    "For now, the only two classical operations supported in Qmod are `repeat` (which is the equivalent of a Python `for` loop) and `if-else` statements. See a [detailed description](https://docs.classiq.io/latest/reference-manual/qmod/language-reference/statements/classical-control-flow/).\n",

    "\n",
    "How to do this? Knowing that a general qubit array can be easily initialized to the state of all zeros; i.e., $|0000000000\\rangle$, you need to flip the state of every second qubit or all the qubits in an even position (the qubits in the $0th$ position, $2nd$ position, $4th$ position, etc.).\n",

    "\n",
    "The `apply_condition` function receives a qubit variable named `qubit` and a classical integer variable `index`. If the `index` variable is an even number, apply an `X` gate on the `qubit`, which flips its state."
