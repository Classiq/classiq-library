    "Quantum variables and operations lie at the heart of the Qmod language but they are not enough for designing any quantum algorithm one has in mind. To complete the picture we need also the ability to perform classical control flow with classical operations over classical variables. These are the operations that a typical Python user would expect to have like `for` loops and `if-else` statements over `int` or `float` variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Qmod, there are equivalent types for the common Python types `int`, `float` and `bool` and they are denoted by `int`, `real` and `bool` in the native syntax and by `CInt`, `CReal` and `CBool` respectively in the Python SDK. In addition, arrays of classical values are also supported as well as more configurable data structures called `Struct`s (which are the equivalent of Python dataclasses without methods). The full list of all the classical variables and types supported in Qmod can be found [here](https://docs.classiq.io/latest/user-guide/platform/qmod/language-reference/classical-types/#structs). \n",
    "\n",
    "For now, the only two classical operations supported in Qmod are `repeat` which is the equivalent of a Python `for` loop and `if-else` statements. The detailed description of both can be found [here](https://docs.classiq.io/latest/user-guide/platform/qmod/language-reference/statements/classical-control-flow/).\n",

    "Our task is to create a quantum array with $10$ qubits in the state of $|1010101010\\rangle$, i.e. a quantum state with alternating qubit states of zeros and ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "How shell we approach this? Knowing that a general qubit array can be easily initialized to the state of all zeros i.e. $|0000000000\\rangle$, we can see that we need to flip the state of every second qubit, i.e. of all the qubits in an even position (the qubit in the $0th$ position, $2nd$ position, $4th$ position etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "So we will approach this task in two steps. First we will create a function called `apply_condition` that receives a qubit and its position within the qubit array, and if the position is even then it flips its state. Secondly, we will go over all the qubits in the qubit array and apply the function on each qubit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `apply_condition` function receives a qubit variable named `qubit` and a classical integer variable `index`, and if the condition that the variable `index` is an even number, then there is a `X` gate applied on the `qubit` which flips its state."
