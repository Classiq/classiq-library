  "description": "This notebook shows how to design a flexible Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) that takes a parametric unitary U(p)=U^p, enabling efficient use with Hamiltonian simulation. It demonstrates declarative and programmatic modeling in Qmod, using the flexible QPE with Trotter-Suzuki evolution to explore phase estimation for eigenvalue estimation. Classiq's second-order function style avoids the exponential cost of naively repeating the unitary.",
