  "description": "This notebook implements discrete-time quantum walks on one- and two-dimensional lattices. It builds the evolution from coin and shift operators in Qmod and illustrates the ballistic spreading that distinguishes quantum walks from classical random walks. Classiq's quantum arithmetic and control flow keep the implementation concise.",
