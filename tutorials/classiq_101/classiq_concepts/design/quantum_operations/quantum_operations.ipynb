    "Quantum computing resembles classical computing in some aspects, and is substantially different in other aspects. One of the key advantages of Qmod is that it captures uniquely quantum core concepts in a simple and natural way. This begins with the quantum objects and variables described in the previous tutorial (see [Quantum Variables and Functions](../quantum_variables_and_functions/quantum_variables_and_functions.ipynb)) and continues with the meaningful native quantum operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply put, quantum operations are functions of functions applied on quantum objects that are very common in quantum computing, hence receiving a special place in the Qmod language. More accurately, these are built-in statements in the Qmod language. A statement is a building block of a programming language, such that programming languages are composed from statements. For example, `if` and `for` loops are common statements in programming languages such as Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few quantum operation statements in Qmod, and here we focus on arguably the most useful one: `control`. It applies a specified quantum function conditioned on some state (value) of a given quantum variable. Other key quantum operations are `invert`, `power`, `within_apply` and `bind`. \n",

In the above example, the `control` operation applies the `inplace_xor` function on the quantum variable `y` conditioned on the value of the quantum variable `x` being $15$.\n",

    "* In the Python SDK, write the quantum operations just like any other Python function. The arguments of the quantum operation that are functions by themselves must be passed with the `lambda:` keyword. In the above example, the `stmt_block` argument of the `control` function is a function by itself (`inplace_xor`), hence it is prefixed with `lambda:`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Other quantum operations are `power` (raising a unitary to some power), `invert` (applying the inverse of a unitary), `within_apply` (applying two unitaries $U$ and $V$ as $UVU^\\dagger$) and `bind` (rewiring qubit(s) referenced by a source variable to a destination variable).
