    "Classical variables and operations lie at the heart of the Qmod language, but they are complemented by classical control flow and operations, making it easier to design quantum algorithms with hybrid quantum-classical logic. With the latest updates, Qmod now fully supports Python's classical operations, such as `for` loops, `if-else` statements, and more, smoothly integrating with quantum workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Qmod, equivalent types for common Python `int`, `float`, `list`, and `bool` types are denoted by `int`, `real`, `array`, and `bool` in the native syntax and by `CInt`, `CReal`, `CArray`, and `CBool` in the Python SDK. The Qmod types can be used in quantum workflows, though Python types can also be passed as classical parameters. For example, when writing quantum workflows, it is possible to use both the length of a quantum array, which is a Qmod quantity, or a Python `int` quantity to control the action of a loop. This ensures the type consistency required for quantum control flow operations like `repeat` (the Qmod equivalent of a Python `for` loop) and `if-else` statements, which enable sophisticated hybrid control logic, see a [detailed description](https://docs.classiq.io/latest/qmod-reference/language-reference/statements/classical-control-flow/). Additionally, Qmod supports arrays of classical values and more configurable data structures called `Struct`s (equivalent to Python dataclasses without methods). See the full list of [classical variables and types supported in Qmod](https://docs.classiq.io/latest/qmod-reference/language-reference/classical-types/#structs). \n",
    "\n",
    "While Qmod enables the integration of Python types within its quantum workflows, the converse is not true with the capabilities covered so far. Python control flow constructs, such as `range`, `for` loops and `if-else` statements, cannot yet incorporate Qmod-specific quantities such as the `len` of a quantum array, within Pythonâ€™s native control flow. Qmod quantities remain tightly integrated within the Qmod execution environment and cannot directly influence Python logic, ensuring a clear separation between classical Python constructs and Qmod quantum operations."

These functions allow the interaction between quantum and classical variables, enabling advanced logic and operations. Currently, it is possible to benefit from the following Python features within quantum programs using generative functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`range`**: Generate sequences of classical values to iterate quantum operations dynamically over classical types within Qmod types. \n",
    "- **`if` statements**: Define conditional logic for generating and applying quantum operations using Qmod types as classical control parameters.\n",
    "- **Treating quantum constants as classical**: Converts parameters intricate to the quantum systems to Python types. This allows one to use, for example, integration of functions from external packages such as `math.sqrt` over classical quantities of a quantum object, such as the `len` of a quantum array.\n",
