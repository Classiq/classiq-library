    "In quantum computing, an oracle is a device used to encode information about a function without explicitly revealing its explicit rule, it is also known as black box. It plays a crucial role in many quantum algorithms, such as Grover's search algorithm and the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm. The oracle can be thought of as a tool that, when given a specific input, produces an output according to an unknown function $f(x)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Great! But how do we represent and construct an oracle in a quantum circuit? In general, an oracle is represented by a unitary operator $U_f$. This operator acts on a quantum state to evaluate a function $f(x)$. For example, in the context of Grover's [[3](#grover_paper), [4](#childs_notes)] and Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm [[1](#dj_paper), [2](#dj_tutorial), [4](#childs_notes)], the oracle $U_f$ takes the action $U_f|x\\rangle |y\\rangle = |x\\rangle |y\\oplus f(x)\\rangle$. Both of these algorithms provide speedups in the number of steps required for its execution, when compared to its classical counterparts. "

    "However, in general, the construction of an oracle is not a trivial task. Implementing a quantum oracle requires encoding the desired function into a quantum circuit. This often involves designing a series of quantum gates that represent the function's logic. While the specifics can vary, the general approach is to create a circuit where the function $f(x)$ influences the qubits in a way that reflects its output."

    "One of the main challenges in using quantum oracles is constructing efficient and scalable representations for complex functions. As quantum computing technology advances, finding optimal methods for oracle construction and integration into quantum algorithms remains an active area of research. For instance, let's examine the oracle for the following function, which can be used in the context of the [Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm](https://docs.classiq.io/latest/explore/algorithms/deutsch_jozsa/deutsch_jozsa/), as a balanced function:"

In other words, if we were to build an oracle for this function, it should flip the $y$ bit every time $x = 0$ mod $2$. Even though, in this case, we can construct such oracle in a clever way, it is not always an easy task to build it.\n",
