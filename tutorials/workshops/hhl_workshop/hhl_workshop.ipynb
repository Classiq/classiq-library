    "\n",
    "The usecase treated above is a canonical one, assuming the following properties:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) The RHS vector $\\vec{b}$ is normalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) The matrix $A$ is an Hermitian one.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) The matrix $A$ is of size $2^n\\times 2^n $.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) The eigenvalues of $A$ are in the range $(0,1)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, any general problem that does not follow these conditions can be resolved as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1) As preprocessing, normalize $\\vec{b}$ and then return the normalization factor as a post-processing\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Symmetrize the problem as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "0 & A^T \\\\\n",
    "A & 0\n",

    "0  \\\\\n",
    "\\vec{x}\n",
    "\\end{pmatrix}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This increases the number of qubits by 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Complete the matrix dimension to the closest $2^n$ with an identity matrix. The vector $\\vec{b}$ will be completed with zeros.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "A & 0 \\\\\n",
    "0 & I\n",

    "\\vec{x}  \\\\\n",
    "0\n",
    "\\end{pmatrix}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "4) If the eigenvalues of $A$ are in the range $[-w_{\\min},w_{\\max}]$ you can employ transformations to the exponentiated matrix that enters into the Hamiltonian simulation, and then undo them for extracting the results:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\tilde{A}=(A+w_{\\min}I)\\left(1-\\frac{1}{2^{m}}\\right)\\frac{1}{w_{\\min}+w_{\\max}}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The eigenvalues of this matrix lie in the interval $[0,1)$, and are related to the eigenvalues of the original matrix via\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\lambda = (w_{\\min}+w_{\\max})\\tilde{\\lambda}\\left[1/\\left(1-\\frac{1}{2^{n_{m}}}\\right)\\right]-w_{\\min},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "with $\\tilde{\\lambda}$ being an eigenvalue of $\\tilde{A}$ resulting from the QPE algorithm. This relation between eigenvalues is then used for the expression inserted into the eigenvalue inversion, via the `AmplitudeLoading` function."
