    "# Qmod Workshop - Part 1: Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The Classiq platform features a high-level quantum modeling language called Qmod. Qmod is compiled into concrete gate-level implementation using a powerful synthesis engine that optimizes and adapts the implementation to different target hardware/simulation environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop demonstrates how to write quantum models using Python embedding of Qmod, available as part of the Classiq Python SDK. You will learn basic concepts in the Qmod language such as functions, operators, quantum variables, and quantum types. You will develop useful building blocks and small algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Qmod language reference](https://docs.classiq.io/latest/qmod-reference/language-reference/) covers these concepts more systematically and includes more examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "This workshop consists of step-by-step exercises. It is structured as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Part 1: Language Fundamentals - Exercises 1-5\n",
    "- Part 2: Higher-Level Concepts - Exercises 6-10\n",
    "- Part 3: Execution Flows - Exercises 11-12\n",
    "\n",
    "The introduction and Part 1 are included in this notebook. Parts 2 and 3 are each in their own notebook. The solutions to the exercises are at the bottom of each notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Preparations\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you have a Python version of 3.8 through 3.12 installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Install the Classiq Python SDK using the instructions in [Getting Started - Classiq](https://docs.classiq.io/latest/user-guide/synthesis/getting-started/).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Python Qmod Exercises - General Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "To synthesize and execute your Qmod code:\n",
    "1. Make sure you define a `main` function that calls the functions you create.\n",
    "2. Construct a representation of your model using `create_model` by running `qmod = create_model(main)`.\n",
    "3. Synthesize the model (using `qprog = synthesize(qmod)`) to obtain the implementation; i.e., a quantum program.\n",
    "4. Visualize the quantum program (using `show(qprog)`) or execute it (using `execute(qprog)`. See: [Execution - Classiq](https://docs.classiq.io/latest/classiq_101/classiq_concepts/execute/) ). You can also execute it with the IDE after visualizing the circuit.\n"
