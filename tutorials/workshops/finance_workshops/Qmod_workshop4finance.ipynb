    "# The Qmod Workshop -  Introduction\n",

    "The Classiq platform features a high-level quantum modeling language called Qmod. Qmod is compiled into concrete gate-level implementation using a powerful synthesis engine that optimizes and adapts the implementation to different target hardware/simulation environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop, we will learn how to write quantum models using Qmod. We will be using the Python embedding of Qmod, available as part of the Classiq Python SDK. We will learn basic concepts in the Qmod language, such as functions, operators, quantum variables, and quantum types. \n",
    "\n",
    "The [Classiq webpage](https://docs.classiq.io/latest/) covers these concepts more systematically and includes more examples. For specific function you can use the [reference manual](https://docs.classiq.io/latest/qmod-reference) tab.\n",

    "<u>**2) There must be a `main` function**</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "Every quantum algorithm written in Qmod must have a `main` function. From this `main` function, the quantum program is created using the `synthesize(create_model(main))` command in Python or just by pressing the Synthesis button in the IDE.\n",

The type of both them is `QNum`, which stands for a quantum number, a type of `quantum variable`. In addition to the type, the variables of the `main` function must be declared as `Output` which indicates these quantum variables are not initialized outside the scope of the function. The `Output`s are measured, unlike auxiliary qubits.\n",
