    "In Finance models we are often interested in calculating the average of a function of a given probability distribution ($E[f(x)]$). The most popular method to estimate the average is Monte Carlo [[1](#MCMF)] due to its flexibility and ability to generically handle stochastic parameters.\n",
    "Classical Monte Carlo methods, however, generally require extensive computational resources to provide an accurate estimation.\n",
    "By leveraging the laws of quantum mechanics, a quantum computer may provide novel ways to solve computationally intensive financial problems, such as risk management, portfolio optimization, and option pricing.\n",
    "The core quantum advantage of several of these applications is the Amplitude Estimation algorithm [[2](#AEA)] which can estimate a parameter with a\n",
    "convergence rate of $\\Omega(1/M^{2})$, compared to $\\Omega(1/M)$ in the classical case, where $M$ is the number of Grover iterations in the quantum case and the number of the Monte Carlo samples in the classical case. This represents a theoretical quadratic speed-up of the quantum method over classical Monte Carlo methods!"

    "### Option Pricing\n",
    "\n",
    "An option is the possibility to buy (call) or sell (put) an item (or share) at a known price - the strike price (K), where the option has a maturity price (S).\n",
    "The payoff function to describe for example a European call option will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$f(S)=\\\n",
    "\\Bigg\\{\\begin{array}{lr}\n",
    "    0, & \\text{when } K\\geq S\\\\\n",
    "    S - K, & \\text{when } K < S\\end{array}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The maturity price is unknown. Therefore, it is expressed by a price distribution function, which may be any type of a distribution function.\n",
    "For example a log-normal distribution: $\\mathcal{ln}(S)\\sim~\\mathcal{N}(\\mu,\\sigma)$,\n",
    "where $\\mathcal{N}(\\mu,\\sigma)$ is the standard normal distribution with mean equal to $\\mu$ and standard deviation equal to $\\sigma$ .\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### To estimate the average option price using a quantum computer, we need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Load the distribution, that is, discretize the distribution using $2^n$ points (n is the number of qubits) and truncate it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Implement the payoff function that is equal to zero if $S\\leq{K}$ and increases linearly otherwise.\n",
    "  The linear part is approximated in order to be properly loaded using $R_y$ rotations [[3](#QAR)].\n",
    "\n",
    "- Evaluate the expected payoff using amplitude estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithmic framework is called Quantum Monte-Carlo Integration. For a basic example, see [QMCI](https://github.com/Classiq/classiq-library/blob/main/algorithms/amplitude_estimation/qmc_user_defined/qmc_user_defined.ipynb).\n",
    "Here we use the same framework to estimate european call option, where the underlying asset distribution at the maturity data is modeled as log-normal distribution."
