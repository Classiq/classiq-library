  "description": "This workshop (part 3 of the quantum optimization training) continues portfolio optimization with QAOA, focusing on inequality constraints (e.g. total weight ≤ budget). Same problem setup as part 2; the emphasis is on encoding inequality constraints in the quantum model. Includes TODOs and solutions.",
