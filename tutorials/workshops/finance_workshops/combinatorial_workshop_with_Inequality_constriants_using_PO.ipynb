        "### Introduction\n",
        "\n",
        "Portfolio optimization [[1](#PortfolioWiki)] is the process of allocating a portfolio of financial assets optimally, according to some predetermined goal. Usually, the goal is to maximize the potential return while minimizing the financial risk of the portfolio. One can express this problem as a combinatorial optimization problem like many other real-world problems. In this demo, we'll show how the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) [[2](#QAOA)] can be employed on the Classiq platform to solve the problem of portfolio optimization.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Modeling the Portfolio Optimization Problem\n",
        "\n",
        "As a first step, we have to model the problem mathematically. We will use a simple yet powerful model, which captures the essence of portfolio optimization:\n",
        "\n",
        "- A portfolio is built from a pool of $n$ financial assets, each asset labeled $i \\in \\{1,\\ldots,n\\}$.\n",
        "- Every asset's return is a random variable, with expected value $\\mu_i$ and variance $\\Sigma_i$ (modeling the financial risk involved in the asset).\n",
        "- Every two assets $i \\neq j$ have covariance $\\Sigma_{ij}$ (modeling market correlation between assets).\n",
        "- Every asset $i$ has a weight $w_i \\in D_i = \\{0,\\ldots,b_i\\}$ in the portfolio, with $b_i$ defined as the budget for asset $i$ (modeling the maximum allowed weight of the asset).\n",
        "- The return vector $\\mu$, the covariance matrix $\\Sigma$ and the weight vector $w$ are defined naturally from the above (with the domain $D = D_1 \\times D_2 \\times \\ldots \\times D_n$ for $w$).\n",
        "\n",
        "With the above definitions, the total expected return of the portfolio is $\\mu^T w$ and the total risk is $w^T \\Sigma w$. We'll use a simple difference of the two as our cost function, with the additional constraint that the total sum of assets does not exceed a predefined budget $B$. We note that there are many other possibilities for defining a cost function (e.g. add a scaling factor to the risk/return or even some non-linear relation). For reasons of simplicity we select the model below, and we assume all constants and variables are dimensionless.\n",
        "Thus, the problem is, given the constant inputs $\\mu, \\Sigma, D, B$, to find optimal variable $w$ as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "$\\begin{equation*}\n",
        "\\min_{w \\in D}  w^T \\Sigma w - \\mu^T w,\n",
        "\\end{equation*}$\n",
        "subject to $\\Sigma_{i} w_i \\leq B$.\n",
        "\n",
        "The case presented above is called integer portfolio optimization, since the domains $D_i$ are over the (positive) integers.\n",
        "Another variation of this problem defines weights over binary domains, and will not be discussed here.\n"
