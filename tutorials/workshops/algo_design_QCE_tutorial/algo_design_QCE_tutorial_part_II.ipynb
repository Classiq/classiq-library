    "## Representing Hard Constraints as Cost\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost operator in QAOA is typically defined in terms of QUBO expressions, or more generally low-degree polynomials over problem variables. In Qmod this is directly expressible using the *phase* statement. But logical operators are not allowed in the *phase* expression, because they cannot be reduced to low-degree polynomials. The feasible value defined by the problem is the value sum *if* the constraint is satisfied *and otherwise zero*. An expression of this form cannot be used directly in *phase* statement. A common approach is to add to the overall cost a penalty term for violating the constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "For equality constraints we can square the difference between the variable expression and its target to obtain a non-negative penalty. However, in the knapsack case we need to represent an *inequality* constraint. An inequality expression can be rewritten as an equality by introducing a *non-negative* slack (\"don't-care\") variable that represents the difference between the left and right sides of the inequality. When evaluating an assignment the slack variable is disregarded. As an example, the constraint $x + y \\leq 10$ can be expressed as $x + y + slack = 10$. In this case the penalty will be $(x + y + slack - 10)^2$. The cost layer multiplies the penalty term can be given more significance by multiplying it by a constant \"penalty factor\", e.g. $2*(x + y + slack - 10)^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The penalty approach has the downside of not representing the true semantics of the problem. It incentivises assignments that have high value with only a small violation of the constraint.
