    "## Representing Hard Constraints as Cost\n",
    "\n",
    "The cost operator in QAOA is typically defined in terms of QUBO expressions, or more generally low-degree polynomials over problem variables. In Qmod this is directly expressible with the *phase* statement. But logical operators in phase arithmetic cannot be efficiently synthesised into gate-level descriptions. So we cannot express the knapsack cost directly in terms of the feasible value defined by the problem - the value sum *if* the constraint is satisfied *and otherwise zero*.\n",
    "\n",
    "A common approach is to add a penalty value to the overall cost for violation of the constraint. For equality constraints we can square the difference between the expression over the variables and its target value to obtain a non-negative penalty. However, in the knapsack case we need to represent an *inequality* constraint. An inequality expression can be reduced to an equality by introducing another *non-negative* slack (\"don't-care\") variable that represents the difference between the left and right sides of the inequality. When considering the assignment the slack variable is simply disregarded. As an example, the constraint $x + y \\leq 10$ can be expressed as $x + y + slack = 10$. In this case the penalty will be $(x + y + slack - 10)^2$. The cost layer multiplies the penalty term can be given more significance by multiplying it by a constant \"penalty factor\", e.g. $2*(x + y + slack - 10)^2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The penalty-term approach has the downside of not representing the true semantics of the problem. It incentivises assignments that have high value with only a small violation of the constraint. But our problem is defined in terms of a hard constraint, where even a small violation means zero actual value.\n",
