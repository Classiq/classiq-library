  "description": "This workshop (Part I) teaches high-level algorithm design with Qmod: language concepts, quantum types, and evaluation modes. It walks through Qmod structure with small examples and includes five code exercises (with TODOs and solutions). Part II applies these concepts in a full algorithm (QAOA for knapsack).",
