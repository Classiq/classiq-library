  "description": "This workshop (Part II) applies Qmod concepts to implement QAOA for the knapsack problem. It compares two ways to encode the hard constraint—phase penalty vs digital (computational-basis) conditional—and includes a Max-Cut warm-up. Three code exercises with solutions are provided. Assumes completion of Part I.",
