    "### The `@qfunc` decorator\n",
    "Qmod is a quantum computing language embeded into Python. The decorator `@qfunc` marks a Qmod function, so that the Qmod interpreter is called to handle it. The decorator is used in every quantum function definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The function `main`\n",
    "Any Qmod code that is intended to be synthesized into an executable quantum program must define a function `main`. The function `main` acts as the program's quantum entry point - it specifies the inputs and outputs of the quantum program, that is, its interface with the external classical execution logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The `Output` modifier\n",
    "All quantum variables that are to be measured must be declared using the `Output` modifier.\n",
    "The variable `x` declared in `main`'s definition is marked as an `Output`, meaning that it is to be measured...\n",
    "Function main cannot declare quantum arguments other than using the output modifier, since the classical execution logic cannot pass quantum states as arguments. "
