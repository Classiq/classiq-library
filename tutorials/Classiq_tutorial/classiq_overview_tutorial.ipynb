    "Having said that, we have no choice but to run multiple times (many more than $2^3$ in our case) to make sure that we measure all `x`s of interest. A classical computer could obtain the same information in exactly $2^3$ runs.\\\n",
    "Then, why bother?\\\n",
    "While pure arithmetic alone may never be a primary task for quantum computers, quantum arithmetic plays a crucial role in many quantum algorithms that do exploit quantum speedup. For example, it is widely used in oracle functions within Grover’s search algorithm and in quantum cryptographic protocols."
