    "## Qmod Fundementals\n",
    "This simple model demonstrates several features that are essential in every Qmod code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The `@qfunc` decorator:\\\n",
    "   Qmod is a quantum computing language embeded into Python. The decorator `@qfunc` marks a Qmod function, so that the Qmod interpreter is called to handle it. The decorator is used in every quantum function definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The function `main`:\\\n",
    "   Any Qmod code that is intended to be synthesized into an executable quantum program must define a function `main`. The function `main` acts as the program's quantum entry point - it specifies the inputs and outputs of the quantum program, that is, its interface with the external classical execution logic. Other functions (`foo` as an example) can of course be defined and called, but if we track back the function calls they always point back to `main`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Quantum variables initialization:\\\n",
    "   Every quantum variable must be initialized. Initialization means __allocating qubits to the variable and determining its initial state__. There are several ways to initialize a quantum variable:\n",
    "   - The most basic way demonstrated above is calling `allocate`. This method requires specifying directly the number of qubits to be allocated to the variable, and the state of all these qubits is automatically set to the default $|0\\rangle$. \n",
    "   - More advanced methods (to be covered later) include assigning an arithmetic expresssion to the variable, calling state-preparation function and more - such methods automatically determine the number of qubits to allocate based on the information that we wish the variable to represent.\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. The `Output` modifier:\\\n",
    "   The `Output` modifier indicates that a quantum variable is not initialized outside the scope of the function, and hence must be initialized inside the scope of the function.\\\n",
    "   For example, in the above `main` function definition, `q` is declared with the `Output` modifier, so `main` expects it to not yet be initialized when called. `foo`, on the other hand, declares its input `q` without the modifier, hence it is essential to initialize `q` before passing it to `foo` (see the call to `allocate` in the code).\n",
    "   - Since `main` is the quantum entry point, all of its inputs must be declared with the `Output` modifier. Please take a moment to think about it: suppose that we would decalre an input `x` to `main` without the `Output` modifier. It follows that `x` must have been initialized before calling `main`, and was passed to main already initialized, but it would be impossible because `main` is the origin of any quantum logic - all its external interfaces are classical."
