    "## Qmod Fundementals\n",
    "The simple model above demonstrates several features that are essential in every Qmod code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The `@qfunc` decorator:\\\n",
    "   Qmod is a quantum programming language embedded in Python. The decorator `@qfunc` designates a quantum function, so that it can be processed by the Qmod tool chain. The Python function is executed at a later point to construct the Qmod representation. This decorator is used for every Qmod function definition.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Function `main`:\\\n",
    "   A complete Qmod model, that is, a description that can be synthesized and executed, must define a function called `main`. Function `main` is the quantum entry point - it specifies the inputs and outputs of the quantum program, that is, its interface with the external classical execution logic. Similar to conventional programming languages, function `main`, can call other functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Working with quantum variables:\\\n",
    "   Quantum objects (numeric, boolean or other values that are stored in specific qubits) are managed in Qmod using quantum variables. All variables need to be declarded and initialized.\\\n",
    "   The model above demonstrates two important kinds of declaration:\n",
    "   -  Function `foo` declares `q` as follows: `q: QBit`. Such declaration (a normal, or \"inout\" declaration) means that `foo` expects to be passed an already-initialized variable `q`, of type `QBit`.\n",
    "   -  Function `main` declares `q` as follows: `q: Output[QBit]`. Such declaration means that `q` is only an output - it is to be initialized inside the scope of `main`.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   The meaning of initialization is specifying to which quantum object the variable refers. Without initialization, a variable is just \"a name\", not pointing to any specific object, and hence no operation can be done it. There are several ways to initialize variables in Qmod:\n",
    "   -  One way is using `allocate`. An `allocate` statement allocates yet-unused qubits to the variable.\n",
    "   -  Other ways include arithmetic assignment, state-preparation and more.\n",
    "  \n",
    "   \n",
    "   Note: it is useful to notice that all the variables in `main` must be declared as `Output`, as `main` is the entry point of the model (Think about it: where could a variable be initialized before `main` was called?). Other functions use both kinds of declaration.\n",
