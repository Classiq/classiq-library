  "description": "This implementation is based on the paper  and was written in collaboration with Chi-Fang (Anthony) Chen, the first author of the paper. Quantum thermal state preparation is the task of preparing the Gibbs state , which is the quantum state in a thermal equilibrium. In difference with ground state preparation, here one looks for properties of a quantum system which is coupled to an environment in a certain temperature",
