  "description": "This tutorial demonstrates how coding with Qmod is simple and intuitive, closely resembling classical programming. The example includes a one-to-one comparison between classical random walks and quantum walks through a specific case: a walk on a circle. In addition, it illustrates how to implement a generic discrete quantum walk routine, specialized for a walk on a hypercube. The implementation makes use of built-in arithmetic and defines quantum functions that take a list of quantum callables as a parameter.",
