# Quantum Walks/Glued trees

- **Quantum Walks** Demonstrates the encoding of a quantum random walk. The example includes a one-to-one
  comparison between classical random walks and quantum walks through a specific case: a walk on a circle.
  In addition, it illustrates how to implement a generic discrete quantum walk routine, specialized for a
  walk on a hypercube. The implementation makes use of built-in arithmetic and defines quantum functions that
  take a list of quantum callables as a parameter.
