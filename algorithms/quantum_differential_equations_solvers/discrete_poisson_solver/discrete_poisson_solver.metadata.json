  "description": "Implementation of a quantum solver for the discrete Poisson equation, a partial differential equation (PDE) widely used in physics and engineering. The equation models the distribution of a potential field due to a prescribed source term. The problem is reformulated as a system of linear equations and solved using the HHL algorithm. Leveraging quantum cosine and sine transforms from the open library enables a concise and clear implementation that can be generalized to higher dimensions.",
