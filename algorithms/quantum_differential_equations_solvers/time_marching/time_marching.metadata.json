  "description": "This demonstration is based on the  paper. The notebook was written in collaboration with Prof. Di Fang, the first author of the paper. Time marching is a method for solving differential equations in time by integrating the solution vector through time in small discrete steps, where each timestep depends on previous timesteps. This paper applies an evolution matrix sequentially on the state and makes it evolve through time, as done in time-dependent Hamiltonian simulations.",
