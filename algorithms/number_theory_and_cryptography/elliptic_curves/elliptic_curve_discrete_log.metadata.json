  "description": "Implementation of solving the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP) with Shor's algorithm, a fundamental cryptographic problem underlying elliptic curve cryptography. Classical algorithms require exponential time; the quantum algorithm runs in polynomial time. The notebook introduces elliptic curves over finite fields and builds the solution using Classiq's modular arithmetic and quantum subroutines.",
