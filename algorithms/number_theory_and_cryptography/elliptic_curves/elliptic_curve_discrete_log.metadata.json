  "description": "Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem \u2013 Notebook Description\n\nThis notebook introduces the Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP) and its relevance to elliptic\u2011curve cryptography (ECC). It reviews the geometry and algebra of elliptic curves, first over the reals and then over finite fields, explaining point addition, point doubling, and scalar multiplication. The discrete logarithm problem is then specialized to the elliptic\u2011curve setting: given a base point G and a target point P on the curve, the task is to recover the integer \u2113 such that P = \u2113 \u00b7 G.\n\nTo make the ideas concrete, the notebook works with a small elliptic curve over a finite field, enumerates its points, and visualizes or tabulates the group law. It then outlines how Shor\u2019s quantum algorithm can be adapted to ECDLP by encoding elliptic\u2011curve arithmetic into quantum operations: preparing superpositions over scalars, performing controlled point additions, and arranging the computation so that the hidden period in \u2113 can be extracted by quantum phase\u2011estimation\u2013style techniques. Throughout, classical helper functions are used to implement finite\u2011field arithmetic and elliptic\u2011curve operations that support the quantum subroutines.\n\nKey points:\n- Explains elliptic curves, the group law, and scalar multiplication over finite fields.\n- Defines the ECDLP and connects it to the general discrete logarithm problem.\n- Uses a worked small\u2011field example to illustrate point enumeration and group structure.\n- Describes how to map elliptic\u2011curve arithmetic into quantum circuits suitable for Shor\u2011type algorithms.",
