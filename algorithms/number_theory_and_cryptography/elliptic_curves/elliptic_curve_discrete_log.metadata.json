  "description": "Implementation of Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP) is a fundamental cryptographic challenge that underlies the security of elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). While classical algorithms require exponential time to solve ECDLP, Shor's quantum algorithm can solve it efficiently in polynomial time. An elliptic curve is a special type of mathematical curve defined by a cubic equation. For our purposes, we can think of it as the set of points that satisfy the Weierstrass equation:",
