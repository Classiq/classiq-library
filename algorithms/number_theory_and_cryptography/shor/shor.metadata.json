  "friendly_name": "Shor's Algorithm Modular Exponentiation",
  "description": "This notebook presents a full implementation of Shor’s quantum algorithm for integer factorization, from problem statement through quantum period finding and classical post‑processing. It begins with an overview of how factoring reduces to order‑finding for modular exponentiation, and how that order can be extracted via Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE). The notebook then defines classical helpers for picking random coprimes, computing continued fractions, and verifying factors from the recovered period.\\n\\nOn the quantum side, the notebook constructs a flexible QPE routine that repeatedly applies modular multiplication by a constant, implemented with Classiq’s modular arithmetic functions. It demonstrates the algorithm on a concrete example (factoring 21) by building the period‑finding circuit, executing it, and using continued fractions to infer the order. Finally, it validates that the recovered factors multiply back to the original integer and includes technical notes that derive the relevant eigenstates, eigenphases, and QPE precision requirements.\\n\\nKey points:\\n- Explains the factoring problem, Shor’s reduction to period finding, and the role of QPE.\\n- Implements a parameterized `period_finding` quantum function using modular multiplication in place.\\n- Uses continued fractions to process the measured QPE phases into an integer order r.\\n- Derives the nontrivial factors of N from r and checks correctness on an explicit example.\\n- Includes detailed theoretical appendices on eigenstates of modular multiplication and phase‑register sizing.",
