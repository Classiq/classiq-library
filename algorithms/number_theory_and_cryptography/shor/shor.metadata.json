  "description": "Shor\u2019s Factoring Algorithm \u2013 Notebook Description\n\nThis notebook presents a full implementation of Shor\u2019s quantum algorithm for integer factorization, from problem statement through quantum period finding and classical post\u2011processing. It begins with an overview of how factoring reduces to order\u2011finding for modular exponentiation, and how that order can be extracted via Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE). The notebook then defines classical helpers for picking random coprimes, computing continued fractions, and verifying factors from the recovered period.\n\nOn the quantum side, the notebook constructs a flexible QPE routine that repeatedly applies modular multiplication by a constant, implemented with Classiq\u2019s modular arithmetic functions. It demonstrates the algorithm on a concrete example (factoring 21) by building the period\u2011finding circuit, executing it, and using continued fractions to infer the order. Finally, it validates that the recovered factors multiply back to the original integer and includes technical notes that derive the relevant eigenstates, eigenphases, and QPE precision requirements.\n\nKey points:\n- Explains the factoring problem, Shor\u2019s reduction to period finding, and the role of QPE.\n- Implements a parameterized `period_finding` quantum function using modular multiplication in place.\n- Uses continued fractions to process the measured QPE phases into an integer order r.\n- Derives the nontrivial factors of N from r and checks correctness on an explicit example.\n- Includes detailed theoretical appendices on eigenstates of modular multiplication and phase\u2011register sizing.",
