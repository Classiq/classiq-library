  "description": "A full implementation of Shor’s factoring algorithm, one of the foundational quantum algorithms, providing an exponential speedup over currently known classical algorithms. The quantum component is naturally structured as a Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) routine, utilizing Classiq’s built-in `flexible_qpe` and modular arithmetic.",
