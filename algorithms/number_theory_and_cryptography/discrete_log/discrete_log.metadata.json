  "description": "Implementation of Discrete Logarithm Problem  was shown by Shor  to be solved in a polynomial time using quantum computers, while the fastest classical algorithms take a superpolynomial time. The problem is at least as hard as the factoring problem. In fact, the hardness of the problem is the basis for the Diffie-Hellman  protocol for key exchange. The algorithm is a specific instance of the Abelian Hidden Subgroup Problem .",
