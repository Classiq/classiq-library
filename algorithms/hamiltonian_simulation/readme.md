# Hamiltonian Simulation

This folder explores standard and advanced Hamiltonian simulation methods,
including product-formula decompositions and block-encoding–based techniques such as QSP,
qubitization, and QSVT. The examples illustrate how quantum time evolution can be implemented
efficiently within modern algorithmic frameworks.

- **Hamiltonian simulation guide** - Provides an introduction and overview to standard Hamiltonian simulation methods.
  The methods are described and implemented utilizing Classiq's built-in functions. First, the product formula
  based methods, Suzuki-Trotter decomposition and qDrift are introduced and implemented. Following,
  more advanced block-encoding, as qubitization and quantum singular value decomposition, are presented.
- **Hamiltonian simulation with block encoding** - The notebook demonstrates how to implement Hamiltonian simulation with
  three block-encoding methods: Generalized Quantum Signal Processing (QSP), Qubitization, and Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT).
  Each method is explained and defined independently and finally compared.
