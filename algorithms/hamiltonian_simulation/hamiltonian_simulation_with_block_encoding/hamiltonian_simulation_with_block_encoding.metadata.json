  "description": "Implementation of time-independent Hamiltonian simulation via block-encoding: approximating the evolution operator e^{-iHt} to precision ε using polynomial transformations of the encoded operator. The notebook demonstrates three state-of-the-art methods—QSVT, GQSP, and Qubitization (Chebyshev)—which give optimal scaling in time and error and are the core building blocks for many higher-level algorithms (e.g. HHL, quantum Gibbs state sampling). It compares trade-offs: Qubitization avoids classical preprocessing but uses more qubits; QSVT uses two auxiliary qubits and no controlled block-encoding; GQSP uses one auxiliary qubit and no amplification. This routine is central to simulating physical and chemical systems on quantum hardware.",
