  "description": "Hamiltonian Simulation with Block Encoding, QSVT, GQSP, and Qubitization \u2013 Notebook Description\n\nThis notebook demonstrates state\u2011of\u2011the\u2011art Hamiltonian simulation techniques based on block encoding and polynomial transformations of operators. Starting from a concrete two\u2011qubit Hamiltonian expressed as a sum of Pauli strings, it uses an LCU construction to build a block\u2011encoding unitary and verifies that this encoding reproduces H|\u03c8\u27e9 up to a known scaling factor. A statevector simulator and custom post\u2011processing are set up to project onto the successful block subspace and compare quantum results with exact classical evolution.\n\nThe notebook then implements three Hamiltonian simulation strategies\u2014GQSP, QSVT, and Chebyshev\u2011LCU (Qubitization)\u2014all derived from the Jacobi\u2013Anger expansion and Chebyshev polynomial approximations of e^{-iHt}. For each method it computes classical signal\u2011processing angles or coefficients, builds the corresponding quantum circuits using Classiq\u2019s open\u2011library functions, runs the simulations, and compares the final state to the exact time evolution. Finally, it summarizes resource trade\u2011offs (qubit count, CX depth, classical preprocessing time, and effective scaling factors) and provides technical notes on block encoding, LCU, walk operators, and generalizations.\n\nKey points:\n- Constructs and verifies a block\u2011encoding of a Pauli\u2011sum Hamiltonian via LCU.\n- Explains Jacobi\u2013Anger\u2013based polynomial approximations for time evolution and how they set circuit degree.\n- Implements Hamiltonian simulation using GQSP, QSVT, and a Chebyshev\u2011LCU walk\u2011operator approach.\n- Uses statevector post\u2011selection and overlap metrics to validate each method against classical evolution.\n- Compares methods in terms of qubit overhead, CX counts, scaling factors, and preprocessing cost.",
