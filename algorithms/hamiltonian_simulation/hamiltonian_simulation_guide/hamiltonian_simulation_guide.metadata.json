  "description": "Implementation of quantum hamiltonian simulation. Hamiltonian simulation considers one of the most important problems in quantum computing. It consists of modeling the time evolution of a complex quantum system using more controllable devices; the quantum computers. Simulations of this type are essential to comprehend quantum systems that are described by complex dynamics, such as molecules in chemistry or materials in condensed matter physics, where classical computers fail due to the exponential scale up required by larger quantum systems.",
