  "description": "Implementation of quantum Hamiltonian simulation: modeling time evolution of quantum systems using Classiq. The guide introduces Suzuki-Trotter decomposition and qDRIFT product formulas, with exponentiation under depth constraints, and links to block-encoding methods. Applications include chemistry, materials science, and algorithms such as HHL and Gibbs state sampling.",
