    "> The **Adaptive Derivative-Assembled Pseudo-Trotter Variational Quantum Eigensolver (ADAPT-VQE)** [[1](#ADAPT-VQE)] is a variational hybrid algorithm, which constitutes an extension of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) framework [[2](#VQE)], that constructs problem-specific ansätze in a systematic and adaptive manner. Instead of relying on a fixed, heuristic circuit structure, ADAPT-VQE iteratively grows the state ansatz by selecting operators from a predefined pool based on their energy gradients with respect to the current variational state. At each iteration, the operator that yields the largest energy reduction is appended to the circuit and its parameters are reoptimized. This adaptive procedure significantly reducing the number of variational parameter and circuit depth, making ADAPT-VQE particularly well suited for near-term quantum hardware.\n",

    "## Algorithm steps\n",
    "The algorithm builds and constructs the ansatz iteratively, one operator at a time, including only the most significant operators. This approach builds a minimal, problem-specific ansatz, avoiding unnecessary parameters and allowing systematic improvement of the accuracy. Similarly to VQE, the algorithms essentially reduce the circuit depth at the expense of measurements. \n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, we define an operator pool ${\\cal O}=\\{O_1,O_2,\\cdots,O_M\\}$, containing a collection of anti-Hermitian operators that are employed in the ansatz construction.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then follow the following procedure:\n",
    "1. Initialize the qubits to the reference state, $| \\Psi_{\\text{ref}}\\rangle$, and define the initial iterative state as $| \\psi^{(0)}\\rangle = | \\Psi_{\\text{ref}} \\rangle$.\n",
    "2. Prepare a trial quantum state with the current ansatz, denoted by $|\\psi^{(n)}\\rangle$, where $n=0,1,\\dots$ corresponds to the iteration step number (initially set to zero).\n",
    "3. Measure the commutator of the Hamiltonian with the operators of $\\cal{O}$. The expectation value corresponds to the partial derivative of the energy (in the $n$ iteration step) with respect to the coefficient of $O_j$: $$\\frac{\\partial E^{(n+1)}}{\\partial \\theta_j}\\bigg |_{\\theta_j=0} = \\langle\\psi^{(n)}|\\partial_{\\theta_i}e^{-\\theta_i O_j} H e^{O_j \\theta_j}|\\psi^{(n)}\\rangle {\\bigg |}_{\\theta_j = 0}+ \\langle\\psi^{(n)}|e^{-\\theta_j O_j} H \\partial_{\\theta_j}e^{O_j \\theta_j}|\\psi^{(n)}\\rangle {\\bigg |}_{\\theta_j = 0}$$ $$= {{\\langle \\psi^{(n)}|  [H, O_j] |\\psi^{(n)}\\rangle}}~.$$ Hence, the measured commutation relations, provides the gradiant $\\nabla_\\vec{\\theta} E$, where $\\vec{\\theta} = \\{\\theta_1,\\dots,\\theta_M\\}^T~~.$ \n",
    "4. If the magnitude of the gradient vector is below a certain threshold, stop. Otherwise, identify the operator with the largest gradient, and add it to the left end of the ansatz, with a new variational parameter. If $A_n\\in \\{O_i\\}$ is an operator with the largest gradient on the step $n$, the update rule is given by $$|\\psi^{(n+1)} \\rangle = e^{\\theta_n A_n} |\\psi^{(n)}\\rangle~~.$$  Note, that the added operator still remains in the operator pool, therefore may be added again later on.\n",
    "5. Conduct a VQE experiment to re-optimize all the ansatz parameters, $\\{\\theta_1,\\dots,\\theta_n\\}$.\n",
    "6. Go back to step 3 and take $n\\rightarrow n+1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The final optimized ansatz is of the form $$| \\psi^{\\text{ADAPT}}(\\vec{\\theta}) \\rangle = \\Pi_{n=1}^{p} e^{\\theta_n A_n}|\\psi_{\\text{ref}}\\rangle~~,$$ where $p$ is the total number of iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that when multiple quantum computers are available, the preparation of the trial state and measurement of the commutation relations with the Hamiltonian can be performed in parallel, substantially reducing the runtime."
