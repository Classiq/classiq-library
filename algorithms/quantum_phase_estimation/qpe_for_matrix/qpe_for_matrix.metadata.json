  "description": "Implementation of quantum phase estimation (qpe) is a key algorithm in quantum computing, allowing you to estimate the eigenphase of a unitary matirx (or the eigenvalue of a hermitian matrix). the algorithm is designed such that given the inputs of a hermitian matrix and an eigenvector , the output obtained is , where by measuring the accumulated phase, the qpe algorithm calculates the eigenvalues relating to the chosen input vector.",
