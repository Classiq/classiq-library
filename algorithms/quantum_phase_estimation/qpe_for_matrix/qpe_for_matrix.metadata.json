  "description": "Quantum Phase Estimation for Matrix Eigenvalues \u2013 Notebook Description\n\nThis notebook presents a generic use of Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) to approximate eigenvalues of a small Hermitian matrix. It starts from a 4\u00d74 real symmetric example matrix, constructs a Pauli\u2011operator representation of the corresponding Hamiltonian, and explains why rescaling is required so that eigenvalues fall into the phase range [\u22121/2, 1/2). Utility functions estimate an overall normalization factor, normalize the Hamiltonian, and compute how many phase\u2011register qubits are needed to achieve a user\u2011specified energy resolution.\n\nAn initial state is prepared either as a random vector or an eigenvector, and QPE is built using Classiq\u2019s `qpe_flexible` routine with two alternative powered\u2011unitary implementations: an exact exponentiation via `unitary(elements=exp(i 2\u03c0 M_new))` and an approximate Suzuki\u2013Trotter product formula with power\u2011dependent repetition counts. The notebook executes both quantum programs, converts sampled phases back to energy estimates using the stored normalization, and compares them to the true eigenvalues of the original matrix. It also visualizes the resulting energy histograms with overlays showing classical eigenvalues and resolution bands.\n\nKey points:\n- Describes normalization and precision budgeting for QPE on generic Hermitian matrices.\n- Implements QPE with an exact unitary and with a first\u2011order Suzuki\u2013Trotter approximation.\n- Shows how to translate measured phases into approximate eigenvalues and account for resolution error.\n- Plots quantum energy distributions against classical eigenvalues for side\u2011by\u2011side comparison.",
