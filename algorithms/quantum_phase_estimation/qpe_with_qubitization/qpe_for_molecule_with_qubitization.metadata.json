  "description": "This notebook is based on Ref. . Given an efficient block-encoding for a Hamiltonian, this algorithm preforms an efficient Quantum Phase Estimation. The core quantum function of this model uses almost all Qmod built-in operations: control, power, within_apply, and invert. The algorithm assumes we have the block-encoding of a matrix",
