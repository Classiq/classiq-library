  "description": "This notebook implements a quantum phase estimation (QPE) scheme tailored to qubitized Hamiltonians in quantum chemistry. Starting from a simple H₂ molecular geometry and a chosen basis, it uses OpenFermion and PySCF to build a fermionic Hamiltonian, maps it to a qubit operator, and computes the exact ground‑state energy for reference. The qubit Hamiltonian is then normalized and block‑encoded using an LCU‑style construction based on a Gray‑code multiplexed Pauli implementation, yielding a unitary whose top‑left block encodes H/s.\\n\\nWith the block encoding in hand, the notebook defines a Szegedy‑type walk operator W and shows how its eigenphases relate nonlinearly to the Hamiltonian’s eigenvalues. It first demonstrates a “naive” QPE directly on W, post‑processes the measured walk eigenphases into energy estimates, and compares them to the classical FCI reference. It then builds an optimized QPE circuit specialized to the walk operator that significantly reduces circuit depth while preserving energy accuracy, and analyzes the expected phase‑to‑energy error given the phase‑register size.\\n\\nKey points:\\n- Constructs a small molecular Hamiltonian and an exact classical ground‑state energy benchmark.\\n- Builds a block‑encoding using Gray‑code multiplexed rotations and amplitude‑encoded coefficients.\\n- Defines and uses a walk operator whose spectrum encodes the Hamiltonian eigenvalues via arccos.\\n- Implements both naive and walk‑optimized QPE circuits and compares their depth and accuracy.\\n- Provides post‑processing utilities for mapping measured phases back to physical energy values.",
