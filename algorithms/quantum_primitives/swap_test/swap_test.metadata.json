  "description": "This notebook demonstrates the swap test, a quantum routine for estimating the overlap between two quantum states. It explains the mathematical relation between the probability of measuring the test qubit in state |0⟩ and the squared inner product |⟨ψ₁|ψ₂⟩|². The notebook prepares two random 3‑qubit states on a simulator, implements the swap test using Classiq’s high‑level Qmod functions, and executes the resulting circuit many times to obtain accurate statistics.\\n\\nAfter running the circuit, the notebook compares the overlap extracted from the swap‑test measurement outcomes with the exact classical overlap computed from the state vectors. It then validates the result within a user‑defined relative tolerance, illustrating how experimental noise and finite sampling affect the estimate.\\n\\nKey points:\\n- Introduces the theory of the swap test and its circuit structure (Hadamard, controlled‑SWAPs, Hadamard).\\n- Shows how to prepare arbitrary amplitudes on registers using `prepare_amplitudes`.\\n- Uses Classiq’s modeling, synthesis, and execution workflow to build and run the swap‑test circuit.\\n- Includes a numerical comparison between quantum‑estimated and classically computed overlaps.",
