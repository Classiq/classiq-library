  "description": "Implementation of swap test is a quantum function that checks the overlap between two quantum states. The inputs of the function are two quantum registers of the same size, , and it returns as output a single test qubit whose state encodes the overlap between the two inputs: , with \\alpha^2 = \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1+|\\langle \\psi_1 |\\psi_2 \\rangle |^2\\right). Thus, the probability of measuring the test qubit at state is if the states are identical (up to a global phase) and 0.",
