  "description": "Swap Test Algorithm \u2013 Notebook Description\n\nThis notebook demonstrates the swap test, a quantum routine for estimating the overlap between two quantum states. It explains the mathematical relation between the probability of measuring the test qubit in state |0\u27e9 and the squared inner product |\u27e8\u03c8\u2081|\u03c8\u2082\u27e9|\u00b2. The notebook prepares two random 3\u2011qubit states on a simulator, implements the swap test using Classiq\u2019s high\u2011level Qmod functions, and executes the resulting circuit many times to obtain accurate statistics.\n\nAfter running the circuit, the notebook compares the overlap extracted from the swap\u2011test measurement outcomes with the exact classical overlap computed from the state vectors. It then validates the result within a user\u2011defined relative tolerance, illustrating how experimental noise and finite sampling affect the estimate.\n\nKey points:\n- Introduces the theory of the swap test and its circuit structure (Hadamard, controlled\u2011SWAPs, Hadamard).\n- Shows how to prepare arbitrary amplitudes on registers using `prepare_amplitudes`.\n- Uses Classiq\u2019s modeling, synthesis, and execution workflow to build and run the swap\u2011test circuit.\n- Includes a numerical comparison between quantum\u2011estimated and classically computed overlaps.",
