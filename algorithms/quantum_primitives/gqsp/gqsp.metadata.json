  "description": "Implementation of generalized quantum signal processing (gqsp) is a quantum algorithmic primitive that extends standard qsp, allowing one to block-encode arbitrary polynomials of unitary operations [\\[1\\]](#ref-gqsp). it removes the “realness” and parity restrictions on achievable polynomials that appear in qsp [\\[2\\]](#ref-grand) and provides a simple recipe for constructing complex polynomials with on the unit circle. moreover, it can be used to implement polynomials with negative powers, i.e.",
