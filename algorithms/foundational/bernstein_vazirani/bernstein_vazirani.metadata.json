  "description": "Implementation of Bernstein-Vazirani (BV) algorithm, introduced by Ethan Bernstein and Umesh Vazirani, is a fundamental quantum algorithm that addresses a special case of the hidden-shift problem. It employs the same functional circuit structure as the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm and achieves a linear speedup over its classical counterpart in the oracle query model.",
