  "description": "Implementation of quantum teleportation protocol, first proposed by bennett et al., is a foundational quantum communication method that enables the transfer of an arbitrary qubit state from one location (alice) to another (bob) using a combination of quantum entanglement and classical communication. it does not involve physically moving the qubit but rather transmitting its quantum information through shared entanglement.",
