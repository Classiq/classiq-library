    "# Solving Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem with Shor's Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction and Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP)** is a fundamental cryptographic challenge that underlies the security of elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). While classical algorithms require exponential time to solve ECDLP, Shor's quantum algorithm can solve it efficiently in polynomial time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Elliptic Curve Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "An elliptic curve is a special type of mathematical curve defined by a cubic equation. For our purposes, we can think of it as the set of points $(x, y)$ that satisfy the **Weierstrass equation**:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E : y^2 = x^3 + ax + b$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $a$ and $b$ are constants that define the specific shape of the curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Properties**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Smooth curve**: The curve has no sharp corners, breaks, or self-intersections (this requires $4a^3 + 27b^2 \\neq 0$)\n",
    "- **Symmetric**: The curve is symmetric about the x-axis - if $(x, y)$ is on the curve, then $(x, -y)$ is also on the curve\n",
    "- **Point at infinity**: We add a special \"point at infinity\" denoted $\\mathcal{O}$ that serves as the identity element for point addition , as will be explained in the next section. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cryptographic Context**:\n",
    "\n",
    "For cryptographic applications like Bitcoin's digital signatures, we work with elliptic curves over **finite fields** $\\mathbb{F}_p$ where $p$ is a large prime number. Instead of the smooth curves we might visualize over real numbers, we get a discrete set of points:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E(\\mathbb{F}_p) = \\{(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{F}_p \\times \\mathbb{F}_p \\mid y^2 = x^3 + ax + b\\} \\cup \\{\\mathcal{O}\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The crucial property for cryptography is that these points form a **group** under a special addition operation. This means:\n",
    "- You can **\"add\"** any two points on the curve to get another point on the curve\n",
    "- There's an identity element ($\\mathcal{O}$) where $P + \\mathcal{O} = P$ for any point $P$\n",
    "- Every point has an inverse\n",
    "- Addition is associative: $(P + Q) + R = P + (Q + R)$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Elliptic Curve Point Addition Works\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**The elliptic curve \"addition\" operation geometric interpretation**: To add two points $P$ and $Q$ on the curve, draw a straight line through them. This line will intersect the elliptic curve at exactly one more point $R'$. The sum $P + Q$ is then defined as the reflection of $R'$ across the x-axis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"resources/elliptic_curve_addition.png\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\">\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "***Figure 1**: Visualized representation of the addition operation on the elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 - 5x + 6$ over the real field.*\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algebraic Process**:\n",
    "This geometric process translates into explicit coordinate formulas:\n",
    "1. Calculate a slope $\\lambda$ based on the input points\n",
    "2. Use $\\lambda$ to compute the x-coordinate of the result: $x_3 = \\lambda^2 - x_1 - x_2$\n",
    "3. Use $\\lambda$ and $x_3$ to compute the y-coordinate: $y_3 = \\lambda(x_1 - x_3) - y_1$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Elliptic Curve Addition Cases**:\n",
    "In general, elliptic curve point addition must handle several cases:\n",
    "1. **Generic case**: Two distinct points $P \\neq Q$ where $P \\neq -Q$\n",
    "  - Slope: $\\lambda = \\frac{y_Q - y_P}{x_Q - x_P} \\pmod{p}$\n",
    "2. **Point doubling**: Adding a point to itself $P + P$\n",
    "  - Slope: $\\lambda = \\frac{3x_P^2 + a}{2y_P} \\pmod{p}$\n",
    "3. **Inverse points**: $P + (-P) = \\mathcal{O}$ (point at infinity)\n",
    "4. **Adding point at infinity**: $P + \\mathcal{O} = P$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Group Property**:\n",
    "This addition rule ensures that the sum of any two points on the curve is always another point on the curve, maintaining the group property essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP)\n",
    "\n",
    "*<div class=\"alert alert-success\">Formally, an instance of the **Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP)** is defined as follows: Let $G \\in E(\\mathbb{F}_p)$ be a fixed and publicly known generator of a cyclic subgroup of $E(\\mathbb{F}_p)$ with known order $\\text{ord}(G) = r$. Let $P \\in \\langle G \\rangle$ be a fixed and publicly known element in the subgroup generated by $G$. **The problem is to find the unique integer $l \\in \\{1, 2, \\ldots, r\\}$, called the discrete logarithm, such that $P = l \\cdot G$.** </div>*\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why \"Logarithm\" for Point Addition?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The term **\"discrete logarithm\"** might seem confusing at first in the context of elliptic curves, since the group operation here is **point addition**, not multiplication. However, the **elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP)** is a **special case of the general discrete logarithm problem (DLP)** (see the [\"discrete log\" notebook](https://github.com/Classiq/classiq-library/blob/main/algorithms/algebraic/discrete_log/discrete_log.ipynb)), where the group happens to be defined by elliptic curve point addition rather than modular multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Discrete Logarithm Problem, the group operation is modular multiplication, and exponentiation refers to repeated multiplication . In the elliptic curve setting, the scalar multiplication $l \\cdot G$ refers to adding the point $G$ to itself $l$ times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a comparison of the two settings:\n",

    "- A **target** element ($h$ or $P_{target}$) is known\n",
    "- The task is to find the **exponent or scalar** $l$ such that the group operation applied to the generator yields the target\n",

    "Following the approach in [[1]](#Roetteler), our implementation focuses only on the **generic case** where the two points are distinct, not inverses of each other, and neither is the neutral element. These exceptional cases are rare (for large $p$) , except when the accumulation register is initialized to the neutral element.\n",

    "**Note:** *To avoid edge cases (as described above) through the entire quantum scalar multiplication, we chose to initialize the accumulation elliptic curve point with a non-zero point ($P_0 = [4, 2]$) rather than the neutral element. This strategy does not affect the measurement statistics after the Quantum Fourier Transform, since it only adds a global phase to the final quantum state. We deliberately selected a starting point that lies on the elliptic curve but is not within the subgroup generated by $G$. Additionally, we exploited the fact that the order of $G$ is not a power of 2*\n",
