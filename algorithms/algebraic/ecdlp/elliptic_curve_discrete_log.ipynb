    "# Solving Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem with Shor's Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Introduction and Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Elliptic Curve Discrete Logarithm Problem (ECDLP)** is a fundamental cryptographic challenge that underlies the security of elliptic curve cryptography (ECC). While classical algorithms require exponential time to solve ECDLP, Shor's quantum algorithm can solve it efficiently in polynomial time.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Elliptic Curve Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "An elliptic curve over a field $K$, of characteristic different from 2 and 3, is a projective, non-singular curve of genus 1. It can be defined as the locus of points $(x, y) \\in K \\times K$ satisfying the Weierstrass equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E : y^2 = x^3 + ax + b$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $a, b \\in K$ are constants. The curve is projective since it contains the point at infinity, $\\mathcal{O}$. The curve is non-singular if $4a^3 + 27b^2 \\neq 0$, which ensures that it doesn't have cusps or nodes. The curve is symmetric with respect to the x-axis, a property easily verified by applying the transformation $y \\mapsto -y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For cryptographic applications, including digital signatures used in Bitcoin, the field of interest is the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_p$ for $p > 3$ a prime number. The set of points consisting of $\\mathcal{O}$ and all solutions $(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{F}_p \\times \\mathbb{F}_p$ to the Weierstrass equation is denoted by:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$E(\\mathbb{F}_p) = \\{(x, y) \\in \\mathbb{F}_p \\times \\mathbb{F}_p \\mid y^2 = x^3 + ax + b\\} \\cup \\{\\mathcal{O}\\}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The set $E(\\mathbb{F}_p)$ forms an abelian group with respect to a group operation \"+\", called addition, that is defined via rational functions in the point coordinates with $\\mathcal{O}$ as the neutral element.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Specific Example: $E(\\mathbb{F}_7)$\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll work with a concrete example on a small finite field to demonstrate the concepts, following the approach outlined in Roetteler et al. [[1]](#ref1):\n",
    "\n",
    "**Elliptic Curve**: $y^2 = x^3 + 5x + 4 \\pmod{7}$\n",

    "                                                                    \n",
    "Shor's algorithm solves ECDLP by finding relationships of the form:\n",
    "$$P_0 + x_1 \\cdot G - x_2 \\cdot P_{target} = \\mathcal{O}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathcal{O}$ is the point at infinity, $P_0$ is an auxiliary starting point, and $(x_1, x_2)$ are found using quantum period-finding. From this relationship, the discrete logarithm can be extracted.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm Parameters**:\n",
    "- **Generator point** $G = [0, 5]$ (order 5)\n",
    "- **Starting point** $P_0 = [4, 2]$ (auxiliary point for the algorithm)  \n",
    "- **Target point** $P_{target} = [0, 2]$\n",
    "- **Goal**: Find $l$ such that $l \\cdot G = P_{target}$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mathematical Foundation\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm exploits the periodicity of the function $f(x_1, x_2) = P_0 + x_1 \\cdot G - x_2 \\cdot P_{target}$ in quantum superposition. When this function evaluates to the point at infinity $\\mathcal{O}$, we have:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$P_0 + x_1 \\cdot G = x_2 \\cdot P_{target}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $P_{target} = l \\cdot G$ (by definition of the discrete logarithm), this becomes:\n",
    "$$P_0 + x_1 \\cdot G = x_2 \\cdot l \\cdot G$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Rearranging: $(x_1 - x_2 \\cdot l) \\cdot G = -P_0$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is this function periodic?** The key insight is that if $(x_1, x_2)$ is a solution (i.e., $f(x_1, x_2) = \\mathcal{O}$), then $(x_1 + kr, x_2 + k)$ is also a solution for any integer $k$, where $r$ is the order of the generator $G$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This periodicity arises because:\n",
    "$$f(x_1 + kr, x_2 + k) = P_0 + (x_1 + kr) \\cdot G - (x_2 + k) \\cdot P_{target}$$\n",
    "$$= P_0 + x_1 \\cdot G + kr \\cdot G - x_2 \\cdot P_{target} - k \\cdot P_{target}$$\n",
    "$$= P_0 + x_1 \\cdot G - x_2 \\cdot P_{target} + k(r \\cdot G - P_{target})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Since $r \\cdot G = \\mathcal{O}$ (by definition of order) and $P_{target} = l \\cdot G$:\n",
    "$$= f(x_1, x_2) + k(\\mathcal{O} - l \\cdot G) = f(x_1, x_2) - kl \\cdot G$$\n",
    "\n",
    "When $f(x_1, x_2) = \\mathcal{O}$, we get $f(x_1 + kr, x_2 + k) = -kl \\cdot G$, which equals $\\mathcal{O}$ when $kl \\equiv 0 \\pmod{r}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quantum Period Finding**: The Quantum Fourier Transform extracts this hidden period structure from the superposition of all $(x_1, x_2)$ pairs, revealing relationships that allow us to solve for the discrete logarithm $l$ using continued fractions and modular arithmetic.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the quantum measurement results, we can extract the discrete logarithm $l$ using continued fractions and modular arithmetic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Curve Properties\n",
    "\n",
    "The elliptic curve $y^2 = x^3 + 5x + 4 \\pmod{7}$ contains the following points:\n",
    "- $[0, 2], [0, 5], [2, 1], [2, 6], [3, 2], [3, 5], [4, 2], [4, 5], [5, 0]$\n",
    "- Plus the point at infinity $\\mathcal{O}$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Generator $G = [0, 5]$ properties**:\n",
    "- Order: 5 (since $5 \\cdot G = \\mathcal{O}$)\n",
    "- Multiples: $1 \\cdot G = [0, 5]$, $2 \\cdot G = [2, 1]$, $3 \\cdot G = [2, 6]$, $4 \\cdot G = [0, 2]$, $5 \\cdot G = \\mathcal{O}$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm Complexity and Quantum Advantage\n",
    "\n",
    "**Classical Complexity**: The best known classical algorithms for ECDLP (such as Pollard's rho algorithm) require $O(\\sqrt{n})$ operations, where $n$ is the order of the elliptic curve group. For cryptographically relevant curves with 256-bit keys, this means approximately $2^{128}$ operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quantum Complexity**: Shor's algorithm reduces this to $O((\\log n)^3)$ operations using $O(\\log n)$ qubits, providing an exponential speedup. For the same 256-bit curves, this reduces to approximately $2^{24}$ operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "This exponential quantum advantage is what makes Shor's algorithm a potential threat to elliptic curve cryptography used in modern security systems, including:\n",
    "- TLS/SSL certificates\n",
    "- Bitcoin and cryptocurrency wallets  \n",
    "- Digital signatures\n",
    "- Key exchange protocols\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quantum Algorithm Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Superposition Creation**: Create quantum superposition over all possible values of $k_1$ and $k_2$\n",
    "2. **Quantum Arithmetic**: Perform elliptic curve computation $P_0 + k_1 \\cdot G - k_2 \\cdot P_{target}$ in superposition\n",

This function computes expressions like $P_0 + k \\cdot G$ where $k$ is in quantum superposition, enabling the algorithm to evaluate all possible scalar values simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the heart of `ell_mult_add` lies the fundamental building block: **Quantum Point Addition (`ec_point_add`)** - the reversible quantum implementation of classical elliptic curve point addition. The `ell_mult_add` function uses the double-and-add algorithm to compute scalar multiples $k \\cdot P$ by repeatedly calling `ec_point_add` in a controlled manner based on the binary representation of $k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quantum Point Addition (`ec_point_add`)\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ec_point_add` function performs the fundamental operation of adding two elliptic curve points in a quantum-reversible manner. This is the atomic operation that enables all higher-level elliptic curve arithmetic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Complete Elliptic Curve Addition Cases**:\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, elliptic curve point addition must handle several cases:\n",
    "1. **Generic case**: Two distinct points $P \\neq Q$ where $P \\neq -Q$\n",
    "  - Slope: $\\lambda = \\frac{y_Q - y_P}{x_Q - x_P} \\pmod{p}$\n",
    "2. **Point doubling**: Adding a point to itself $P + P$\n",
    "  - Slope: $\\lambda = \\frac{3x_P^2 + a}{2y_P} \\pmod{p}$\n",
    "3. **Inverse points**: $P + (-P) = \\mathcal{O}$ (point at infinity)\n",
    "4. **Adding point at infinity**: $P + \\mathcal{O} = P$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our Implementation Simplification**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the approach in Roetteler et al. [17] and Gouzien et al. [7], our implementation focuses only on the **generic case** where the two points are distinct, not inverses of each other, and neither is the neutral element. These exceptional cases are rare, except when the accumulation register is initialized to the neutral element.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid edge cases entirely, we initialize the accumulation register with a non-zero point ($P_0 = [4, 2]$) rather than the neutral element. This strategy does not affect the measurement statistics after the Quantum Fourier Transform, since it only adds a global phase to the final quantum state.\n",

    "1. **Input**: Quantum point $(x, y)$ and classical point $G = (G_x, G_y)$\n",
