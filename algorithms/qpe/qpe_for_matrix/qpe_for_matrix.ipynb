    "# Quantum Phase Estimation for Solving Matrix Eigenvalues\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) is a key algorithm in quantum computing, allowing you to estimate the eigenphase of a unitary matirx (or the eigenvalue of a Hermitian matrix). The algorithm is designed such that given the inputs of a Hermitian matrix $M$ and an eigenvector ${|\\psi\\rangle}$, the output obtained is $\\theta$, where\n",
    "\n",
    "$ U{|\\psi\\rangle} = e^{2\\pi i\\theta}{|\\psi\\rangle} , U = e^{2\\pi iM} $.\n",
    "\n",
    "By measuring the accumulated phase, the QPE algorithm calculates the eigenvalues relating to the chosen input vector. To read more about the QPE algorithm and its method for achieving the phase, refer to [[1](#NC)].\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, when the eigenvectors of the matrix are not known in advance yet the eigenvalues are sought, you can choose a random vector ${|v\\rangle}$ for the algorithm’s initial state. Some eigenvalues will be found as the vector can be described in the matrix's basis, defined by the set of eigenvalues of $M$: {$\\psi_i$}. Generally, any vector can be written as a superposition of any basis set, thus\n",
    "\n",
    "${|v\\rangle} = \\sum_i a_i{|\\psi_i\\rangle}$\n",
    "\n",
    "and\n",
    "\n",
    "$U{|v\\rangle} = \\sum_i a_i e^{2\\pi i\\theta_i}{|\\psi_i\\rangle}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using execution with enough shots, you can obtain this set of $\\theta_i$; i.e., a subset of the matrix's eigenvalues.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This tutorial presents a generic usage of the QPE algorithm:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define classical and quantum functions for constructing the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Take a specific example, a matrix and some initial state.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Choose a resolution for the solution.\n",
