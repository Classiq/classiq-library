  "description": "Implementation of adiabatic quantum computing (aqc) leverages the adiabatic theorem to solve computational problems by gradually evolving a quantum system from an initial ground state to the ground state of a problem-specific hamiltonian (see the aqc tutorial). this tutorial focuses on applying the aqc approach to solve the quantum linear systems problem (qlsp), a cornerstone problem in quantum computing with significant applications in fields like machine learning, physics, and optimization.",
