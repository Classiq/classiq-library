  "description": "HHL Algorithm for Quantum Linear Solvers \u2013 Notebook Description\n\nThis notebook implements the Harrow\u2013Hassidim\u2013Lloyd (HHL) algorithm for solving linear systems A x = b and compares quantum results with a classical solution. It begins with a small 4\u00d74 Hermitian matrix A and a normalized right\u2011hand side vector b, checks that A\u2019s eigenvalues lie in (0, 1), and prints their high\u2011precision binary expansions. The matrix is converted into a Pauli\u2011sum Hamiltonian, setting up the unitary U = e^{i 2\u03c0 A} required by QPE.\n\nA modular HHL quantum subroutine is then built: it prepares |b\u27e9 in a \u201cmemory\u201d register, runs flexible QPE to encode eigenphases into an \u201cestimator\u201d register, applies a controlled rotation on an indicator qubit implementing the \u03bb\u207b\u00b9 map via an amplitude table, and finally uncomputes the phases with QPE\u2020. Post\u2011processing routines post\u2011select on successful indicator and estimator outcomes, reconstruct the solution amplitudes, remove the global phase, and compare the resulting |x\u27e9 to the classical A\u207b\u00b9b via fidelity and component\u2011wise plots. The notebook provides two implementations of the time\u2011evolution unitary: an exact one using full matrix exponentiation and an approximate one based on first\u2011order Suzuki\u2013Trotter product formulas with tunable repetition depth.\n\nKey points:\n- Reviews the HHL algorithm steps, including QPE, eigenvalue inversion, and post\u2011selection.\n- Encodes a small Hermitian system into a Pauli\u2011operator Hamiltonian and constructs U = e^{i 2\u03c0 A}.\n- Implements a reusable `hhl` Qmod function parameterized by a powered\u2011unitary evolution routine.\n- Demonstrates exact vs. Suzuki\u2013Trotter\u2011based Hamiltonian simulation within the same HHL framework.\n- Includes utilities to post\u2011select, remove global phase, compute fidelity, and visualize classical vs quantum solutions.",
