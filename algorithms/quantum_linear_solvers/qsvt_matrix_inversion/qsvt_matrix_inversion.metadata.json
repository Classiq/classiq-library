  "friendly_name": "QSVT: Matrix Inversion",
  "description": "Implementation of a general framework for solving linear systems based on the Quantum Singular Value Transform (QSVT). Given an efficient routine to embed the classical matrix as a quantum function (block-encoding), this algorithm provides a clean and optimal approach to implementing matrix inversion compared to other quantum methods. The use of the qsvt_inversion function from the open library, together with classical auxiliary functions from our qsp application, allows for an easy implementation of the algorithm, given two inputs: a block-encoding quantum function for the matrix and the matrix condition number.",
