  "description": "Implementation of grover mixers for qaoa (gm-qaoa) is one of the algorithms applied to constrained optimization problems, where the mixer operator in qaoa is replaced by a parameterized grover diffuser operator that utilizes an equal superposition of all feasible solutions . in the potential challenges of standard qaoa, the cost operator (which applies phases based on the objective function) and the mixer operator (which explores the state space) are alternately applied.",
