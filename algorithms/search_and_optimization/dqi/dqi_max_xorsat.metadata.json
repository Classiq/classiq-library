  "description": "This notebook relates to the paper \"Optimization by Decoded Quantum Interferometry\" (DQI) , which introduces a quantum algorithm for combinatorial optimization problems. The algorithm focuses on finding approximate solutions to the *max-LINSAT* problem, and takes advantage of the sparse Fourier spectrum of certain optimization functions.",
