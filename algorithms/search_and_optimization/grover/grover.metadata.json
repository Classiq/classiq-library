  "description": "This notebook develops Grover’s unstructured search algorithm and applies it to both 3‑SAT and graph Max‑Cut style problems. It reviews the structure of Grover’s iteration as a composition of an oracle U_f and a diffusion operator U_s that jointly amplify amplitudes on marked states, and explains how the required number of repetitions scales like O(√(N/k)). A reusable classical post‑processing routine repeatedly executes a Grover circuit with increasing iteration counts until a marked state appears with probability above a chosen threshold.\\n\\nThe first set of examples encodes small and larger 3‑SAT formulas as Boolean predicates, converts them into phase oracles using Classiq’s `phase_oracle`, and constructs Grover search circuits over a few Boolean variables. After running the algorithm, the notebook prints truth tables, measurement histograms, and highlights the satisfying assignments whose amplitudes have been amplified. A second example recasts a Max‑Cut‑style threshold problem as an oracle that marks cuts with at least a target number of crossing edges, then applies the same Grover‑and‑post‑selection pattern to find high‑quality cuts.\\n\\nKey points:\\n- Provides an intuitive and circuit‑level description of Grover’s operator and repetition schedule.\\n- Implements generic utilities to run Grover with increasing powers until success criteria are met.\\n- Encodes 3‑SAT instances and graph‑cut predicates as phase oracles using high‑level Qmod constructs.\\n- Shows how Grover can be repurposed from exact search to threshold‑based optimization searches.",
