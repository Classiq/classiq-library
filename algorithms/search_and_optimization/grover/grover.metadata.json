  "description": "Grover\u2019s Search Algorithm \u2013 Notebook Description\n\nThis notebook develops Grover\u2019s unstructured search algorithm and applies it to both 3\u2011SAT and graph Max\u2011Cut style problems. It reviews the structure of Grover\u2019s iteration as a composition of an oracle U_f and a diffusion operator U_s that jointly amplify amplitudes on marked states, and explains how the required number of repetitions scales like O(\u221a(N/k)). A reusable classical post\u2011processing routine repeatedly executes a Grover circuit with increasing iteration counts until a marked state appears with probability above a chosen threshold.\n\nThe first set of examples encodes small and larger 3\u2011SAT formulas as Boolean predicates, converts them into phase oracles using Classiq\u2019s `phase_oracle`, and constructs Grover search circuits over a few Boolean variables. After running the algorithm, the notebook prints truth tables, measurement histograms, and highlights the satisfying assignments whose amplitudes have been amplified. A second example recasts a Max\u2011Cut\u2011style threshold problem as an oracle that marks cuts with at least a target number of crossing edges, then applies the same Grover\u2011and\u2011post\u2011selection pattern to find high\u2011quality cuts.\n\nKey points:\n- Provides an intuitive and circuit\u2011level description of Grover\u2019s operator and repetition schedule.\n- Implements generic utilities to run Grover with increasing powers until success criteria are met.\n- Encodes 3\u2011SAT instances and graph\u2011cut predicates as phase oracles using high\u2011level Qmod constructs.\n- Shows how Grover can be repurposed from exact search to threshold\u2011based optimization searches.",
