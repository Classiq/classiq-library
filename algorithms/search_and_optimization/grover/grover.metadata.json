  "description": "Implementation of Grover’s search algorithm, one of the canonical quantum algorithms. A general routine is defined and then applied to generic use cases, including the 3-SAT problem and the Max-Cut problem on a graph. The use of the phase_oracle quantum function from the Classiq open library, together with the Qmod language for high-level arithmetic operations, helps avoid the low-level implementation details typically required on other platforms.",
