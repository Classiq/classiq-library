  "description": "Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) \u2013 Notebook Description\n\nThis notebook implements the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm for two representative combinatorial problems: Max\u2011Cut on a five\u2011node graph and a small knapsack instance. It starts with an accessible explanation of the QAOA ansatz as alternating \u201ccost\u201d and \u201cmixer\u201d layers applied to an initial uniform superposition, and relates the finite\u2011depth circuit to discretized adiabatic evolution. For Max\u2011Cut, the notebook defines a normalized, negative cost function over bitstrings, constructs the corresponding phase\u2011separation circuit, and applies layerwise RX mixers.\n\nUsing Classiq\u2019s modeling and execution tools, the notebook builds a parameterized QAOA circuit, sets up a classical COBYLA optimization loop, and iteratively refines the 2p parameters (gammas and betas) by repeatedly estimating the quantum cost. It then samples the optimized circuit, prints the most probable cuts along with their costs, and visualizes the graph with node colors indicating the best partitions. In the knapsack section, the notebook augments QAOA with a digital constraint check: an objective phase is applied only when a predicate qubit indicates the weight constraint is satisfied, avoiding hand\u2011tuned penalty terms.\n\nKey points:\n- Explains the QAOA framework and its connection to adiabatic optimization.\n- Implements modular cost and mixer layers and composes them into a multi\u2011layer ansatz.\n- Uses a classical optimizer to tune QAOA parameters based on sampled quantum costs.\n- Demonstrates Max\u2011Cut and knapsack instances, printing and plotting high\u2011quality solutions.\n- Includes technical notes on adiabatic theorem conditions and the Trotterization viewpoint of QAOA.",
