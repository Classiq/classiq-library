  "description": "Implementation of Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), introduced by Edward Farhi, Jeffrey Goldstone, and Sam Gutmann , is a hybrid quantum–classical method for tackling combinatorial optimization problems like Max-Cut, scheduling, and constraint satisfaction. It prepares a parameterized quantum state by alternating two simple operations: one that encodes the problem’s cost function and another that “mixes” amplitudes across candidate solutions.",
