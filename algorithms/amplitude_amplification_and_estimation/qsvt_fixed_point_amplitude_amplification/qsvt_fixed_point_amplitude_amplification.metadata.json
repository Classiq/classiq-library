  "description": "This notebook shows how to use the QSVT framework for search problems; specifically, implementing fixed-point amplitude amplification (FPAA). With FPAA, we do not know in advance the concentration of solutions for the search problem, but we want to sample a solution with high probability. In contrast, for the original Grover search algorithm, too many iterations might 'overshoot' the mark. The demo is based on the paper Grand unification of quantum algorithms.",
