  "description": "This demo explains the Oblivious Amplitude Amplification algorithm (OAA) , which can be used as a building block in algorithms such as Hamiltonian simulations. We start with a short recap, then show how to use it in conjunction with the Linear Combination of Unitaries (LCU) algorithm. * Promise: is unitary (or close to unitary).",
