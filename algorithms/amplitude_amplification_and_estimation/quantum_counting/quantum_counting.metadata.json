  "description": "Implementation of the quantum counting algorithm, which efficiently estimates the number of valid solutions to a search problem based on amplitude estimation. This notebook demonstrates how to estimate the counting problem using the Iterative Quantum Amplitude Estimation (IQAE) algorithm, which reduces the required number of qubits and gates compared to Quantum Phase Estimation-based approaches, at the expense of an additional polylogarithmic factor in the error. The example applies the algorithm to count solutions to a simple arithmetic equation, showing both QPE-based and IQAE-based methods.",
