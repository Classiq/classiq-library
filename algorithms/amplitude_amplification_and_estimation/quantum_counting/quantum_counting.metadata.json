  "description": "Quantum Counting with Iterative Quantum Amplitude Estimation \u2013 Notebook Description\n\nThis notebook applies amplitude estimation and quantum counting to determine how many inputs satisfy a given Boolean condition. It begins with a small arithmetic example, where two 2\u2011bit unsigned integers a and b must satisfy (a + b) \u2264 2, yielding six valid assignments out of 16 possibilities. The notebook first shows how standard Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) can be built on top of Grover\u2019s operator to recover the underlying success amplitude and thus infer the number of solutions.\n\nThe core of the notebook is an implementation of the Iterative Quantum Amplitude Estimation (IQAE) algorithm, which avoids QPE and instead adapts the number of Grover iterations across rounds based on previous measurement statistics. A dedicated state\u2011preparation routine prepares a uniform superposition over inputs and flags \u201cgood\u201d states in an indicator qubit, which IQAE then queries and updates until the desired accuracy and confidence level are reached. Finally, the notebook compares the QPE\u2011based and IQAE\u2011based estimates of the number of satisfying assignments and prints the IQAE iteration history (Grover powers and outcome counts).\n\nKey points:\n- Defines a concrete counting problem and encodes it as an oracle over small integer registers.\n- Builds a Grover operator and uses QPE as a baseline amplitude\u2011estimation method.\n- Implements Iterative Quantum Amplitude Estimation via Classiq\u2019s `IQAE` class with user\u2011set error and confidence.\n- Extracts the estimated number of solutions and reports the statistical accuracy and iteration data.",
