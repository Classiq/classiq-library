  "description": "Implementation of the quantum counting algorithm, which efficiently estimates the number of valid solutions to a search problem based on amplitude estimation. The example shows both Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) and Iterative Quantum Amplitude Estimation (IQAE); IQAE reduces qubits and gates at the expense of a polylogarithmic factor in the error. The algorithm is applied to count solutions to a simple arithmetic equation using Classiq's grover_operator and qpe library functions.",
