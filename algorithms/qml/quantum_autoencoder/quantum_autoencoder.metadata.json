  "friendly_name": "Quantum Auto-Encoder",
  "description": "A Quantum Machine Learning (QML) example in which a quantum program is trained to reduce the memory required to encode data with a given structure. In addition, the example demonstrates how to use the encoder for anomaly detection. Two training approaches for the quantum autoencoder are presented, leveraging Classiq’s integration with PyTorch. This example also illustrates the use of the RESET operation.",
