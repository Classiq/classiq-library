  "description": "Implementation of neural networks is one of the major branches in machine learning, with wide use in applications and research. a neural network—or, more generally, a deep neural network—is a parametric function of a specific structure (inspired by neural networks in biology), which is trained to capture specific functionality. in its most basic form, a neural network for learning a function looks as follows: 1. there is an input vector of size (red circles in fig. 1).",
