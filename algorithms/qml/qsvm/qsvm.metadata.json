  "description": "Implementation of quantum support vector machines is the quantum version of classical support vector machines (svm); i.e., a data classification method that separates the data by performing a mapping to a high-dimensional space, in which the data is separated by a hyperplane . qsvm is a hybrid quantum–classical classification algorithm in which classical data are embedded into a high-dimensional quantum hilbert space using a parameterized quantum feature map.",
