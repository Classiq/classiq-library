## Technical Approach
### 1. Data Preparation
- **Dataset Acquisition:** Utilize publicly available datasets such as PDBbind or DrugBank containing molecular descriptors and binding affinities.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, normalize numerical features, and encode categorical variables.
- **Feature Extraction:** Represent molecular structures numerically using descriptors such as:
  - Extended Connectivity Fingerprints (ECFP)
  - Mordred descriptors

### 2. Quantum Feature Selection (QAOA/VQE)
- **Problem Formulation:** Define feature selection as an optimization problem using a cost Hamiltonian:
  \[ H = w z z + b z \]
- **Ansatz Selection:** Utilize a parameterized quantum circuit optimized for QAOA or VQE.
- **Quantum Circuit Construction:** Implement circuits on quantum platforms, optimizing:
  - CX gate count
  - Circuit depth

### 3. Hybrid Model Integration
- **Classical-Quantum Hybrid Model:**
  - Use QAOA/VQE-selected features to train classical ML models (Neural Networks, Random Forest, SVM).
  - Compare quantum-selected features with traditional methods (PCA, LASSO, RFE).
- **Training and Optimization:**
  - Classical models trained using gradient descent.
  - Quantum models optimized via QAOA/VQE optimizers.

### 4. Model Evaluation and Validation
- **Performance Metrics:**
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1-score
- **Benchmarking:** Compare quantum-enhanced feature selection with classical methods based on:
  - Prediction accuracy
  - Feature selection efficiency
  - Computational complexity
