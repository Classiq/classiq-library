  "description": "This notebook implements the Bayesian Phase Difference Estimation (BPDE) algorithm for computing numerical energy gradients in quantum chemistry. It explains how BPDE yields the energy difference between two electronic states and uses it with the finite-difference method for geometry optimization; the example uses the hydrogen molecule with Classiq's chemistry application.",
