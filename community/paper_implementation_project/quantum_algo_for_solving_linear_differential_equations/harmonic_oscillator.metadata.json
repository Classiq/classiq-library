  "description": "This notebook solves the harmonic oscillator (linear differential equation dx/dt = Mx + b) using the quantum algorithm from Phys. Rev. A 101, 032307. Vectors and the matrix are encoded as quantum states and the solution is approximated via Taylor expansion; the unitary case is implemented in Classiq.",
