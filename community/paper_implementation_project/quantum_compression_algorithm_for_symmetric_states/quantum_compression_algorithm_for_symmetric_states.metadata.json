  "description": "Implementation of the quantum compression algorithm for symmetric states (Plesch and Bužek): a circuit compresses n identical (or permutation-symmetric) copies into a lower-dimensional space. The notebook builds the U gate (one-hot to compressed form) and the final binary encoding, and implements it on the Classiq platform.",
