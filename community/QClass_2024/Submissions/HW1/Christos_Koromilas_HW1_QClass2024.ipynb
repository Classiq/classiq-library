Qmod is compiled into concrete gate-level implementation using a powerful synthesis engine that optimizes and adapts the implementation to different target hardware/simulation environments.\n","\n","In this workshop, we will learn how to write quantum models using Qmod. We will be using the Python embedding of Qmod, available as part of the Classiq Python SDK. We will learn basic concepts in the Qmod language, such as functions, operators, quantum variables, and quantum types. We will develop useful building blocks and small algorithms.\n","\n","The [QMOD language reference](https://docs.classiq.io/latest/user-guide/platform/qmod/language-reference/) covers these concepts more systematically and includes more examples.\n","\n","This workshop consists of step-by-step exercises. It is structured as follows:\n","\n","- Part 1: Language Fundamentals - Exercises 1-5\n","- Part 2: Higher-Level Concepts - Exercises 6-10\n","- Part 3: Execution Flows - Exercises 11, 12\n","\n","The introduction and Part 1 are included in this notebook. Part 2 and 3 are each in its own separate notebook. For each exercise you will find the solution to the exercises at the bottom of the same notebook.\n","\n","### Preparations\n","\n","Make sure you have a Python version of 3.8 through 3.11 installed. Unfortunately, Classiq is not yet supported with Python 3.12.\n","\n","Install Classiq’s Python SDK by following the instructions on this page: [Getting Started - Classiq](https://docs.classiq.io/latest/getting-started/).\n","\n","### Python Qmod Exercises - General Instructions\n","\n","In order to synthesize and execute your Qmod code, you should:\n","1. Make sure you define a `main` function that calls functions you create.\n","2. Use `create_model` by running `qmod = create_model(main)` to construct a representation of your model.\n","3. You can synthesize the model (using `qprog = synthesize(qmod)`) to obtain an implementation - a quantum program.\n","4. You can then visualize the quantum program (`show(qprog)`) or execute it (using `execute(qprog)`. See: [Execution - Classiq](https://docs.classiq.io/latest/user-guide/platform/executor/#full-example)). You can also execute it with the IDE after visualizing the circuit.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"JHxeLndXAgo0"},"source":["### Exercise 0: From Model to Execution\n","\n","The following model defines a function that applies X and H gates on a single qubit, and subsequently calls it:"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["!pip install -U -q classiq"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"R0QdrOXUB4uZ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1716212630747,"user_tz":-120,"elapsed":51480,"user":{"displayName":"Christos Koromilas","userId":"17599903479737751299"}},"outputId":"699522f2-0728-407b-ac51-12da76264970"},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m398.1/398.1 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m5.2 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m10.7/10.7 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m860.7 kB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m1.8/1.8 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m43.2 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m75.6/75.6 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m3.9 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m2.0/2.0 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m48.0 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m42.6/42.6 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m4.1 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m3.1/3.1 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m68.9 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m6.4/6.4 MB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m58.5 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m77.9/77.9 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m9.1 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m58.3/58.3 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m5.4 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[2K     \u001b[90m━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━\u001b[0m \u001b[32m49.6/49.6 kB\u001b[0m \u001b[31m5.6 MB/s\u001b[0m eta \u001b[36m0:00:00\u001b[0m\n","\u001b[?25h\u001b[31mERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed.
