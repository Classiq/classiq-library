    "Yes, the `optimal energy` is similar to the one calculated in class (with the help of the `Molecule` and `MoleculeProblem` classes), this is because the calculation in this Part 2 considers the two correlated qubits (we added a CNOT gate between them) so that now the complete system can be considered formed by two qubits, and when calculating the values of the parameters (the angles) these are subject to working for both qubits at the same time.\n",

    "Everything seems to indicate that this will be the case, but to confirm it we need to determine the value of the `nuclear repulsion energy`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The nuclear repulsion energy in a molecule refers to the energy associated with the repulsion between the nuclei of the atoms that compose it. In a molecule, the nuclei of atoms are positively charged and, therefore, repel each other due to the electrostatic force. To calculate this energy, we need to know the internuclear distance $R$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We could determine the distance between the two protons of the $H_2$ molecule from the Hamiltonian provided. To do this, we need to remember that the Hamiltonian coefficients are related to integrals of two electrons and other terms that depend on the internuclear distance $R$. But this is not simple to calculate. In fact, this is an inverse problem that is not solved directly from the Hamiltonian in its given form.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we will consider that the hydrogen molecule is in its ground state, so we can take the average distance between the two nuclei, which would be equal to approximately $74 \\ \\text{pm} $ or $ 0.74 \\ \\text{\u00c5} $ or $0.74 \\times 10^{-10} \\ \\text{m}$.\n",
