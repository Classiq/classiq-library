# Welcome to QClass 2024 Session #2!

**This is our workspace for mastering Git & GitHub skills.**

## What is This Repository For?
We'll use this repository to submit assignments as an initial practice in opening a pull request.

## Getting Started
If you didn't forked and clone the [classiq-library](https://github.com/Classiq/classiq-library) already, follow this:
1. **Fork** the repo to add it to your GitHub account.
2. **Clone** your forked repository to your local machine.

## Submission: Rules & Instructions
To keep track of submissions, we kindly ask you to:
1. Complete the assignment.
2. Rename the files to include your full name, for example: `Nadav_Ben-Ami_HW1_QClass2024.ipynb`.
3. Navigate to your local clone of the `classiq-library`.
4. Go to `community/QClass_2024`.
5. Place your solutions in the correct folder.
6. Use the command line to `add`, `commit`, and `push` those changes to the remote (your fork of the `classiq-library`).
7. Navigate to your GitHub repository `classiq-library` and create a new Pull Request (PR) to merge the changes from your fork to the original repository (`Classiq/classiq-library`). Make sure that your PR is well described.
8. After you are done, please let us know by submitting the form here: [Typfeorm](https://fvrn0h72gwo.typeform.com/to/dKvnZuk6)
