    "# Advanced Quantum Circle Walk Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "This notebook provides a detailed explanation and implementation of the Quantum Circle Walk algorithm. We will cover the advanced theory behind the algorithm, show the implementation in Python using the `classiq` library, and visualize the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task:\n",
    "The goal of this quantum program is to simulate a quantum random walk on a line topology with 16 nodes.\n",
    "In a line topology, the nodes are arranged sequentially, and each node is connected to its immediate neighbors. For example, consider a line of 16 nodes numbered from 0 to 15. In this walk, the walker would move from its current node to an adjacent node (either left or right) with equal probability.\n",
    "![Alt text](image.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Advanced Theory\n",
    "Quantum walks are the quantum analog of classical random walks. They leverage the principles of quantum superposition and interference, allowing quantum walks to explore graphs more efficiently than classical random walks. Quantum walks are crucial in developing quantum algorithms that can outperform classical algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Quantum Walks\n",
    "1. **Discrete-Time Quantum Walks (DTQWs)**: Involve a quantum system (the walker) moving on a discrete set of positions (nodes) according to a unitary evolution operator. The walker's state is described by a quantum superposition of these positions.\n",
    "2. **Continuous-Time Quantum Walks (CTQWs)**: Defined on a continuous time scale, where the evolution of the walk is governed by the Hamiltonian of the system. The probability distribution of the walker's position evolves continuously over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Quantum Circle Walk Algorithm\n",
    "The quantum circle walk algorithm is a specific type of DTQW where the walker moves on a circular graph. This algorithm leverages quantum superposition and interference to explore the graph efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Key Components\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: Prepare the walker in an initial quantum state, often a uniform superposition of all possible positions.\n",
    "2. **Walk Operator (W)**: Evolves the walker's state based on the adjacency matrix of the graph, ensuring that the walker can move to adjacent nodes.\n",
    "3. **Shift Operator (S)**: Conditionally swaps the walker's position based on specific conditions, such as the presence of edges in the graph.\n",
    "4. **Measurement**: Measure the quantum state of the walker to obtain the probability distribution of its position.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Detailed Steps\n",
    "1. **Initialization**: The walker is initialized in a uniform superposition state using a Hadamard transform. This step ensures that the walker starts in an equal superposition of all possible positions on the graph.\n",
    "2. **Walk Operator (W)**: Applied iteratively to evolve the walker's state. It uses unitary operations to adjust the probability amplitudes of the walker's position, mimicking the adjacency matrix of the circular graph.\n",
    "3. **Shift Operator (S)**: Conditionally swaps the walker's position based on the presence of edges in the graph. This operator uses controlled operations to update the walker's position according to the graph's structure.\n",
    "4. **Measurement**: After applying the walk and shift operators for a specified number of steps, the quantum state of the walker is measured. This measurement collapses the superposition state into a specific position, and the probability distribution of the walker's position can be analyzed.\n"
