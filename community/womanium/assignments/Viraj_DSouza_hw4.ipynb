For example, for a line with $N=16$ possible positions (or nodes), a $4$-qubit basis state given by ${\\ket{0}, \\ket{1}, \\ket{2}, \\ldots, \\ket{15}}$ can be used for spanning the discrete position space of the walker.\n",

    "Let $H_C$ be the Hilbert space spanned by the two basis states of a spin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ particle, also called a coin in the context of quantum walk. We denote the two basis states as $\\ket{\\uparrow}$ (spin up) and $\\ket{\\downarrow}$ (spin down). Because of this choice of the coin, the quantum walker can move to two possible positions with certain probabilities during a step of the quantum walk. In more complicated cases (like $2D$ quantum walks) where there can be more than two possible choices, we can choose basis states of a spin-$s$ particle, which allows for $2s+1$ single-step transitions.\n",

    "For simplicity, let's work with a Hadamard coin that allows for equal likelihood for the transition of a quantum walker to the right and to the left. Consider the conditional translation of the quantum walker based on the coin state. That is, if the coin is in the state $\\ket{\\uparrow}$ the position of the walker shifts one step towards the right and if the coin is in the state $\\ket{\\downarrow}$ the position of the walker shifts one step towards the left. The below conditional shift operator achieves this:\n",

    "\n",
    "Example, $$ S\\ket{\\uparrow} \\otimes \\ket{2} = \\ket{\\uparrow} \\otimes \\ket{3}$$ as expected because the coin state $\\ket{\\uparrow}$ dictates the walker to move one step towards the right, which is the position $\\ket{3}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "A quantum random walk has two processes occuring in every step. First, a coin is flipped and then the position state of the walker changes based on the coin flip outcome. This operation is denoted as,\n",
    "$$ U= S(C\\otimes I) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $C$ (here $C=H$, the hadamard operation) is the coin flip operation and $S$ is defined above. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let the initial state be $\\ket{\\uparrow}\\otimes\\ket{0}$, which means the walker is in the position state $\\ket{0}$ and the coin is in the state $\\ket{\\uparrow}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now the coin flip operation followed by action of $S$ yields the following state,\n",

    "$$\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}(\\ket{\\uparrow}\\otimes\\ket{1} + \\ket{\\downarrow}\\otimes\\ket{-1})$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "as expected the walker shifts to left or right of $\\ket{0}$ depending on the coin state. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the coin state is measured and the process is continued we obtain a classical walk. Interesting quantum effects can be seen if we don't measure the states and continue the walk by acting $U$ repeatedly. After several applications of $U$ (several steps of the quantum walk), we will obtain a bimodal distribution of the position of the walker, which will be peaked on the extreme right with a nearly uniform distribution in the middle and a small peak on the extreme left. If the initial state be $\\ket{\\downarrow}\\otimes\\ket{0}$,the bigger peak is on the left. This is clearly different from a classical random walk, which has a peak at the middle (position state $\\ket{0}$)\n",
