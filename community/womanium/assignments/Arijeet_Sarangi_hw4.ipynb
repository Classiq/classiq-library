    "## What is Quantum Walk?\n",
    "\n",
    "A quantum (random) walk is the quantum counterpart of a classical random walk, where the walker (particle) follows a probabilistic path. Quantum random walks can outperform classical random walks in certain computational tasks, such as search algorithms and solving specific mathematical problems more efficiently. They form the basis for some of the most promising quantum algorithms, providing potential speedups for problems that are intractable for classical computers."

For nodes in between, the probabilities are distributed evenly to move either left or right.\n",
