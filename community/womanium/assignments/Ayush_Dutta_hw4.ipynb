    "In this notebook, we will explore the construction of a quantum walk operator for a line with 16 nodes. We will follow the example provided in Bootcamp 4, which dealt with a quantum walk on a circle with 4 nodes. Quantum walks are the quantum analog of classical random walks and have applications in quantum computing, particularly in quantum search algorithms and quantum simulations.\n"

    "In this notebook, we have constructed and visualized the quantum walk operator for a line with 16 nodes. We started by recalling the example of a circle with 4 nodes and then adapted the method for a line. This approach can be extended to other graph structures and used in various quantum algorithms.\n",

    "- Explore different coin operators.\n",
    "- Study the effect of different initial states.\n",
    "- Apply the quantum walk to other graph structures (e.g., grid, complete graph).\n",
