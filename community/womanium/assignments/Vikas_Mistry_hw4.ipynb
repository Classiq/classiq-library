    "## What is a Quantum Walk?\n",
    "\n",
    "A quantum walk is the quantum counterpart of a classical random walk, where a \"walker\" (quantum particle) explores a network by probabilistically transitioning between nodes. Unlike classical random walks that are restricted to definite states, quantum walks exploit the principles of superposition and interference, allowing the walker to exist in multiple states simultaneously. This unique property enables quantum walks to outperform classical random walks in certain tasks, such as search algorithms and solving specific mathematical problems. Quantum walks hold immense promise for the development of powerful quantum algorithms, potentially offering significant speedups for problems considered intractable for classical computers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This document delves into the details of a quantum walk on a line with 16 nodes. We will explore the theoretical underpinnings, followed by a step-by-step implementation using the Classiq framework. The key concepts covered include initializing the quantum state, defining the probability distributions for the walk, and performing the walk using quantum operators, while accounting for the specific boundary conditions of a linear topology.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quantum Walks: Theory\n",
    "\n",
    "A quantum walk is the quantum analog of a classical random walk, where the walker moves between adjacent nodes (or states) with certain probabilities. However, quantum walks leverage superposition and interference, leading to fundamentally different dynamics compared to their classical counterparts.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of quantum walks: discrete-time and continuous-time. Here, we will focus on discrete-time quantum walks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Discrete-Time Quantum Walk\n",
    "\n",
    "A discrete-time quantum walk typically involves two primary operators:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Coin Operator (C):** This operator acts like a quantum coin, determining the direction of the walk. A common choice for the coin operator is the Hadamard operator (H):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}} \\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "1 & 1 \\\\\n",
    "1 & -1\n",
    "\\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The Hadamard operator creates an equal superposition of the \"heads\" and \"tails\" states of the coin, which translates to equal probabilities for moving left or right along the line.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Shift Operator (S):** This operator governs the actual movement of the walker to an adjacent node based on the coin state. For a general graph with nodes labeled from 0 to N-1, the shift operator can be defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "S = \\sum_{x=0}^{N-1} \\left( |(x+1) \\mod N \\rangle \\langle x| \\otimes |0\\rangle \\langle 0| + |(x-1) \\mod N \\rangle \\langle x| \\otimes |1\\rangle \\langle 1| \\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This operator considers the specific topology of the graph (e.g., a circle or a line) to determine the possible movements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Quantum Walk Operator (U)\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall quantum walk operator (U) combines the coin and shift operators:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "U = S \\cdot (I \\otimes C)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where I represents the identity operator on the position space and otimes denotes the tensor product.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Applying to a Line with 16 Nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "For a line with 16 nodes, the shift operator needs to account for the boundary conditions, where nodes at the ends have fewer neighbors. The adjusted shift operator for a line with 16 nodes (0 ≤ x ≤ 15) can be defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "S = \\sum_{x=0}^{15} \\left(\n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "|x+1 \\rangle \\langle x| \\otimes |0\\rangle \\langle 0| + |x-1 \\rangle \\langle x| \\otimes |1\\rangle \\langle 1| & \\text{if } 0 < x < 15 \\\\\n",
    "|x+1 \\rangle \\langle x| \\otimes |0\\rangle \\langle 0| & \\text{if } x = 0 \\\\\n",
    "|x-1 \\rangle \\langle x| \\otimes |1\\rangle \\langle 1| & \\text{if } x = 15\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures that the walker doesn't attempt to move beyond the boundaries of the line.\n"
