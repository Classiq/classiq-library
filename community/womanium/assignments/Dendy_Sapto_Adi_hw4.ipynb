    "# **Quantum Walk Implementation on a Linear Graph Using Classiq Library**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Introduction**\n",
    "Quantum walks, the quantum counterpart of classical random walks, are crucial for various quantum algorithms, such as those used in search and graph traversal. In this notebook, we will delve into the implementation of a quantum walk on a linear graph (a path graph) using the Classiq library. The focus will be on understanding the theoretical foundations and implementing the algorithm step-by-step.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Objectives**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Comprehend the basics of quantum walks:** Explore the differences between quantum and classical walks and their significance in quantum computing.\n",
    "2. **Implement the quantum walk algorithm on a linear graph:** Use Python and the Classiq library to simulate a quantum walk, focusing on the preparation, evolution, and measurement of quantum states.\n",
    "3. **Visualize the quantum circuit:** Generate a quantum circuit that represents the quantum walk, providing a clear view of the operations performed on qubits.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background: Quantum Walks on Graphs\n",
    "### Classical vs. Quantum Walks\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Classical Random Walks:** In a classical random walk, a walker moves step-by-step on a graph, where each step is determined probabilistically. The walker might, for example, move to an adjacent vertex with equal probability.\n",
    "- **Quantum Walks:** Quantum walks leverage quantum superposition and interference, allowing the quantum walker to explore multiple paths simultaneously. This parallelism can lead to significant speedups in quantum algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Quantum Walk Operators\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of quantum walks on a linear graph, we primarily focus on two operators:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Coin Operator (C Operator): This operator determines the direction of the quantum walk. It acts on the state ‚à£ùëó,ùëò‚ü© where ùëó represents the current vertex and ùëò represents the adjacent vertex. The C operator is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$C = \\sum_{j \\in V} |j\\rangle\\langle j| \\otimes (2|\\partial j\\rangle\\langle \\partial j| - I)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, ‚à£‚àÇùëó‚ü© is a superposition of the neighboring vertices of ùëó, and ùêº is the identity operator.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Shift Operator (S Operator):** This operator shifts the quantum state between adjacent vertices on the graph, effectively moving the quantum walker.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Implementation of the Quantum Walk\n",
    "We will now implement the quantum walk on a linear graph with 16 nodes using the Classiq library. The implementation will be broken down into several key steps, including the state preparation, definition of operators, and execution of the quantum walk.\n",
