# Final Assignment - Classiq's Training

Follow the example from the 4th session for creating the quantum walk operator for the case of a circle with 4 nodes, and design the quantum walk operator for the case of a line with 16 nodes.

Create a well-detailed Python Jupyter notebook that explains your algorithm, including the code parts covered in class, and pictures/figures where relevant.
Utilize the attached Python code ([quantum_walk_circle_example.py](./quantum_walk_circle_example.py)) with the example from class for the task.
Feel free to extend the example beyond the requirements here and what was covered in class.

Contribute your notebook to the Classiq Git Library to the folder community/womanium/assignments
