<H1>Quantum Walks vs. Classical Random Walks</H1>


Classical random walks involve a particle moving randomly on a graph or lattice. At each step, the particle has a certain probability of moving to a neighboring node. The behavior of these walks is described by probability distributions.

Quantum walks are the quantum analogue of classical random walks. Instead of probabilities, they involve quantum states and unitary operators. A quantum particle (or walker) can exist in a superposition of states, and its movement is governed by quantum mechanics principles like interference and superposition. This allows for behaviors not possible in classical walks, such as faster exploration of graphs and different probability distributions.
<H1>Designing a Quantum Walk Operator for a 16-Node Line</H1>

The goal of designing a quantum walk operator for a 16-node line is to create a unitary matrix that effectively simulates the movement of a quantum particle along this line. This operator should:

Preserve unitarity: The total probability of the particle being at any node must always be 1.
Incorporate coin flips: Like in classical random walks, a "coin flip" determines the direction of movement. In quantum walks, this is represented by a unitary coin operator acting on the coin state.
Implement shifts: The resulting coin state determines whether the particle moves left or right on the line. This is achieved by a shift operator.
Handle boundary conditions: The operator should define how the particle behaves at the ends of the line. This might involve reflecting the particle or allowing it to leave the line.
By carefully combining these elements, one can construct a quantum walk operator that exhibits quantum interference and potentially offers computational advantages over classical random walks for specific problems.

The quantum_coin_flip function performs a quantum coin flip on the input qubit.


Specifically, it transforms a qubit in the state |0> or |1> into an equal superposition of both states: (|0> + |1>) / sqrt(2).


import classiq 
from classiq import *
@qfunc
def quantum_coin_flip(coin: QBit):
    H(coin)

The prepare_initial_state function creates a uniform superposition over all possible states of the input quantum register x.

@qfunc
def prepare_initial_state(x: QBit):
    for i in range(size):
        H(x[i])


A quantum walk is propelled by two core operations: the Coin Operator and the Shift Operator. The Coin Operator dictates the walker's direction, while the Shift Operator executes the movement. Functionally similar to a coin flip in classical random walks, the Coin Operator determines the subsequent state or direction based on the current position. A straightforward quantum coin can be modeled using a Hadamard gate.
@qfunc
def coin_operator(x: QBit):
    for i in range(size):
        H(x[i])
        
The Shift Operator uses the result from the Coin Operator to move the walker to an adjacent node. This involves conditional operations based on the coin's outcome.
@qfunc
def shift_operator(x: QBit):
    for i in range(size - 1):
        SWAP(x[i], x[i + 1])
        
        
The Shift Operator translates the walker's position based on the coin's outcome, typically implemented using SWAP operations.

The Diffusion Operator is a crucial component that amplifies specific state amplitudes, enhancing their probability of measurement. This process is fundamental to quantum search algorithms, accelerating the discovery of desired solutions.
@qfunc
def diffusion_operator(x: QBit):
    for i in range(size):
        H(x[i])
    # Apply phase shift for diffusion
    for i in range(size):
        X(x[i])
    H(x[0])
    X(x[0])
    H(x[0])
    for i in range(size):
        X(x[i])
    for i in range(size):
        H(x[i])
implement the quantum walk.
@qfunc
def quantum_walk(x: QBit):
    for _ in range(num_steps):
        coin_operator(x)
        shift_operator(x)
        diffusion_operator(x)
        
@qfunc
def measure(x: QBit) -> List[int]:
    return [M(x[i]) for i in range(size)]

x = QBit(size)
