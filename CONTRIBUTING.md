# Contributing to Classiq

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

## We Develop with Github

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Create an issue to discuss what you will be submitting. We will reply swiftly with comments and feedback.
2. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
3. Ensure your code runs with the latest Classiq version.
4. Issue that pull request!
